# Wrangling Rows in R with Filter

In this chapter, we will introduce you ways to wrangle rows in R. You
will often want to focus your analysis on particular **observations**,
or rows, in your dataset. This chapter will show you how to include the
rows you want, and exclude the rows you don't want. The main function in
the tidyverse for doing this is *filter()*. The *filter()* function uses
logical statements, or conditions, to decide whether to keep or exclude
rows in your dataset.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Artwork by Allison Horst, https://www.allisonhorst.com"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/allison_horst_dplyr_filter.jpg")
```

## Goals for this Chapter

-   Understand logical statements
-   Filter rows based on numeric values
-   Filter rows based on string values and *regex*
-   Filter rows based on dates
-   Combine filters with boolean logic symbols, like AND (&) and OR(\|)
-   Filter on missing (NA) values
-   Filter rows for duplicates/distinct observations
-   Slicing rows based on row number/position
-   Sampling rows as random samples

## Packages needed for this Chapter

{tidyverse}

{lubridate}

{medicaldata}

## Pathway for this Chapter

This Chapter is part of the **DATA WRANGLING** pathway. Chapters in this
pathway include

-   What is Tidy Data?
-   Filtering Rows
-   Counting, Grouping, and Summarizing Rows
-   Arranging and Ranking Rows
-   Selecting Columns
-   Mutating to Make New Variables
-   Rearranging Untidy data with {tidyr} and {pivotr}

## Logical Statements in R

Logical statements in R are important for defining something that is
TRUE or FALSE for each row, or observation, in your data. A typical
logical statement involves a variable, and some criteria to test each
observation of that variable, resulting in a TRUE or FALSE for each row.
Typical examples of logical statements include:

-   `sbp > 140`

-   `troponin_i > 9.0`

-   `creatinine >= 2.5`

-   `gfr <= 60`

    Each of these examples tests each row in the database with the
    stated criterion, and results in a vector of TRUE or FALSE values
    for each row (observation) of the variable in the logical statement.
    The *filter()* function will act on these TRUE and FALSE values to
    include (TRUE) or exclude (FALSE) the observations from the result.

## Filtering on Numbers - Starting with A Flipbook

This flipbook will show you step-by-step examples of how to filter rows
of observations based on logical statements involving numbers. In each
logical statement, a variable will be compared with a numeric value via
a mathematical operator. These operators can include comparisons with

-   greater than (\>)

-   greater than or equal to (\>=)

-   less than (\<)

-   less than or equal to (\<=)

-   equal to (==) **notice** two equals signs to test equality

-   near() - an equality test that works with tiny decimal differences

The general format for *filter* statements is:

filter(variable [comparison operator] value), like

filter(sbp \> 140) will keep only rows with systolic blood pressure
values greater than 140.

If you have not used a flipbook before, you can **click** on the frame
below to activate it, then use the **right and left arrow keys** to move
forward and back through the examples.

With each forward step in the code on the left, examine the resulting
output on the right. Make sure you understand how the output was
produced.

In many of the examples, a *select()* function is used to reduce the
number of columns before the *filter()* step to make the results more
clear.

## Filtering on Multiple Criteria with Boolean Logic

You can use multiple filters on your data, and combine these with the
boolean symbols

-   AND (symbol &)

-   OR (symbol \| ) - the vertical line, often on the keyboard above the
    backslash character ( \\ )

-   XOR - exclusive OR, so that the whole logical statement is true if
    either statement A is true, or statement B is true, but NOT if both
    are true. parentheses and combinations thereof.

-   NEGATION - an exclamation point ( ! ) placed before an equals sign
    or a variable in a logical statement makes it mean the
    ***opposite***.

and you can use parentheses as well, to control the order of operations.

## Filtering Strings

You can use == to test exact equality of strings, but you can also use
str_detect from the {stringr} package for more flexible matching, and
combine it with the magic of regex (regex \~ Regular expressions) to do
complicated filtering on character string variables in datasets.

The typical formats for string filtering are

-   filter(variable == "string") for an exact match, or

-   filter(str_detect(variable, pattern = "string")) [**note** two
    parentheses at the end to completely close the parentheses with
    str_detect]

## Filtering Dates

You can use the {lubridate} package to format strings for logical tests,
and filter your observations by date, month, year, etc. Dates are
commonly formatted in ISO 8601 format, or YYYY-MM-DD, for 4-digit year,
2-digit month, and 2-digit day. The {lubridate} package can convert
these to dates if the ymd() function is applied to a string formatted
this way.

The typical formats for date filtering are

-   filter(date == ymd("2002-10-06")) for an exact match, or

-   filter(between(datevar, ymd("2020-01-01", ymd("2020-06-30"))

-   filter(datevar \> today() - years(1)) for the past year

## Filtering Out or Identifying Missing Data

You can use the is.na(), drop_na() and negation with ! to help identify
and filter out (or in) the missing data, or observations that are
incomplete. Common formats for this include

-   is.na(variable) - filters for observations where the variable is
    missing

-   !is.na(variable) - filters for observations where the variable is
    **not** missing

-   janitor::remove_empty("rows") - removes completely empty rows
    (helpful if you are importing a messy dataset)

-   drop_na() - without filter, this drops any observations with at
    least one NA value in the row.

-   drop_na(variable1, variable2) - without filter, this drops any
    observations with at least one NA value iin the variable1 or
    variable2 columns.

### Working with Missing data

A common need when doing DEV (Data Exploration and Validation) is to
find your missing datapoints, so that you can figure out **why** they
are missing, and whether you can fix this using other records, including
the medical record.

Another common scenario, when you can't find or fix missing data, is
that you want to drop observations which are missing in a particular
variable.

Sometimes you will need to drop whole empty rows, which usually happens
because of poor formatting of the data (often in a spreadsheet).

Sometimes you will need to drop observations that have missing data in
any field, which is important in modeling. Linear and logistic models
generally only run on complete cases, where all predictors and outcomes
are non-missing.

You can also impute missing data points, if there are not too many
(\<10%), and these are truly missing completely at random (MCAR), which
is often **not** the case. Usually there is a bias, so that particular
types of study participants have more missing data than others. The
packages {missForest} and {mice} can be helpful for imputation when MCAR
assumptions are met. Imputation is beyond the scope of this chapter, and
should generally be done in consultation with a statistician, as the
assumptions involved are very important.

## Filtering Out Duplicate observations

You can use the *distinct()* function and the {janitor} package to help
you find duplicated observations/rows for fixing or removal from your
dataset.

Common formats for this include

-   distinct(dataset) - filters for rows that are distinct from all the
    other rows (non-duplicates).

-   janitor::get_dupes(dataset) - filters for observations that are
    duplicated in all variables, counts them, and displays them in
    duplicated groups.

## Slicing Data by Row

You can use the *slice()* family of functions to cut out a chunk of your
observations/rows by position in the dataset..

Common formats for this include

-   slice(X:Y) - filters for rows X to Y by position (row number).

-   slice_max(variable, n = N) - filters for observations with the
    maximum N values for a single variable.

-   slice_min(variable, prop = 0.0N) - filters for observations with the
    minimum proportion of 0.0N values for a single variable.

-   slice_head and slice_tail - filter for observations by position in
    the top (or bottom) N or top/bottom proportion.
