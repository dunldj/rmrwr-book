## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r wrangle}
prostate %>% 
  mutate(aa = factor(aa, levels = c(0,1), 
                     labels = c("White", "African-American"))) %>% 
  mutate(fam_hx = factor(fam_hx, levels = c(0,1), 
      labels = c("No Family History", "FHx of Prostate Cancer"))) ->
prostate

```

```{r summarize}
prostate %>% 
  select(age, p_vol, preop_psa, aa, fam_hx) %>% 
  group_by(aa, fam_hx) %>% 
  summarize(across(age:preop_psa, mean, na.rm=TRUE))
  
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(prostate) + 
  aes(x = p_vol, y = preop_psa, col = aa) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_grid(aa ~ fam_hx) +
  labs(x = 'Prostate Volume', y = "Preoperative PSA",
       title = 'Relationship Between Prostate Volume and Preop PSA,\nSubdivided by Family History and Race') +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
  
```
