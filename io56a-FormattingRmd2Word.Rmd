# Header 1

Example of body text  
Note 2 spaces at end of line for line break  
  
Lines smush together if you
don't add the two spaces.
These are semantic line breaks
which go away in the compiled word document
<br>
You can have visible line breaks <br>
if you keep using <br>
html tags <br>
But these are kind of annoying, <br>
and 2 spaces at the end of each line is pretty easy

## R Markdown - level 2

Note that you need a blank line before headers for them to be recognized as headers and formatted properly

### A plot - level 3
```{r cars}
plot(pressure)
```

## Another level 2 header

Note that the default formatting for Rmarkdown to Word is a bit goofy, with blue type and not my favorite font.

### Solutions

We can fix this with a Word formatting template.  
Knit this document.

## Save this document as word-styles.docx
in the same directory as your Rmd file
We will use this docx document as a template (after we reformat)

#### Formatting - Heading 4
Open the word document, Select the Home ribbon, then the Styles window louncher (Styles Pane) in the Styles group.  
  
Select the Title.
It has the Title style. Scroll down to Title style in the Styles Window.
  
Change the font, the color, the size, ext.
Then click on the dropdown arrow to the right of the Title style, and select 'Update Title to Match Selection'.

Then repeat the process for body text, Heading2, Heading3  

Then save the Document.

## Using the Styles Template
Go to the top of your Rmarkdown document.  
It should have 2 dashed lines, with a title and   
  
output: word_document  
  
between them
  
You need to change this to (note that these are real indent tabs)  

output:  
(indent)word_document:  
(indent)(indent)reference_docx: word-styles.docx  
    
Note the placement of the colons, what is on each line, and the indents are critical to making this work.

## Now you are ready!
now save this document and knit - you will get the format you intended. And you can use this template for any future Rmarkdown document - just be sure that you have  
word-styles.docx  
in the folder where your Rmarkdown document lives.  

### Test it
Open a new Rmarkdown document  
Knit the default document to Word   

Then change the output to use the template word-styles.docx  

Then re-Knit the document.
