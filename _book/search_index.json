RMarkdown grew organically, with many spinoffs (blogdown, bookdown, posterdown), with great creativity. But there was not master plan in mind, and a fair number of hacky workarounds became standard. There was some inconsistency between implementations, there was no command-line interface, the approach was specific to R, and past decisions made some new features impossible to implement. So the folks at Posit (formerly RStudio) decided to rebuild RMarkdown from scratch with a coherent master plan, a command line interface, the ability to use many languages (including Python, bash, Julia, etc.), and pathways to more features that were not possible in RMarkdown. In many ways, Quarto documents (*.qmd) look a lot like rmd documents. There is a familiar YAML header, text and code chunks, formatting with markdown tags, and the ability to use Pandoc to render (instead of knit) documents to a variety of output formats. Let’s take a moment to go to the quarto page. Click on the Get Started button to go to the installation page. Now click on the Download Quarto CLI button to download the right version of quarto for your computer. Note that installing a current version of RStudio will also install the Quarto CLI, but it is not an R package. Installation is straightforward - go to your downloads folder, and click on the downloaded file to start the installation process. Once this is complete, and the original package moved to the trash, you are ready to open RStudio and work with Quarto documents and presentations. 33.4 A Tour of Quarto 33.5 Opening a New Quarto Document 33.6 The Visual Editor vs. Source Editor in Quarto 33.7 Adding Code Chunks 33.8 Organized Options in Code Chunks with the Hash-Pipe #| 33.9 Stating Global Options in Your YAML Header 33.9.1 Code options 33.9.2 Parameters 33.9.3 Self-contained 33.10 Figures and Tables 33.11 Inline Code and Caching 33.12 Citations in Quarto 33.13 Exploring further The Quarto Chapter in R for Data Science.
