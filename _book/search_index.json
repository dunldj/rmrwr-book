Higgins, MD, PhD, MSc 2021-06-16 Chapter 1 Preface Welcome to Reproducible Medical Research with R (RMRWR). I hope that this book is helpful to you. 1.1 Who This Book is For This is a book for anyone in the medical field interested in analyzing the data available to them to better understand health, disease, or the delivery of care. This could include nurses, dieticians, psychologists, and PhDs in related fields, as well as medical students, residents, fellows, or doctors in practice. I expect that most learners will be using this book in their spare time at night and on weekends, as the health training curricula are already packed full of information, and there is no room to add skills in reproducible research to the standard curriculum. This book is designed for self-teaching, and many hints and solutions will be provided to avoid roadblocks and frustration. Many learners find themselves wanting to develop reproducible research skills after they have finished their training, and after they have become comfortable with their clinical role. This is the time when they identify and want to address problems faced by patients in their practice with the data they have before them. This book is for you. 1.2 Prerequisites Thank you for giving this e-book a try. This is designed for physicians and others analyzing health data who are interested in pursuing this field using the R computer language. We will assume that: You have access to a computer You have access to the internet You can download and install software from the internet to your computer How to download and install R and RStudio will be addressed, step by step, in Chapter 2. 1.3 The Spiral of Success Structure This book is structured on the concept of a “spiral of success”, with readers learning about topics like data visualization, data wrangling, data modeling, reproducible research, and communication of results in repeated passes. These will initially be at a superficial level, and at each pass of the spiral, will provide increasing depth and complexity. This means that the chapters on data wrangling will not all be together, nor the chapters on data visualization. Our goal is to build skills gradually, and return to (and remind students of) their previously built skills in one area and to add to them. The eventual goal is for learners to be able to produce, document, and communicate reproducible research to their community. 1.4 Motivation for this Book Most medical providers who learn R to do their own data analysis do it on their own time. They rarely have time for a semester-long course, as their clinical schedules usually will not allow it. Fortunately, a lot of people learn R on their own, and there is a strong and supportive R community to help new learners. A 2019 Twitter survey conducted by @RLadies found that more than half of respondents were largely self-taught, from books and online resources. There are a lot of good resources for learning R, so why one more? In part, because the needs of a medical audience are often different. There are distinct needs for protecting health information, generating a descriptive Table One, using secure data tools like REDCap, and creating standard medical journal and meeting output in Word, Powerpoint, and poster formats. Further, while learning from a textbook can be helpful, this e-book has the ability to include interactive features that are important for learning to write your own analysis code. Informative flipbook demonstrations will show you what steps in R code do, and learnr exercises will give you a chance to do your own coding to solve problems, right within this e-book. More and more, all science is becoming data science. We are able to track patients, their test results, and even the individual pixels (voxels) of their CT scans electronically, and use those data points to develop new knowledge. While one could argue that health care workers should collect data and bring it to trained statisticians, this does not work nearly as well as you might expect. Most academic statisticians are incentivized to develop new statistical methods, and are not very interested (nor incentivized) to do the hand-holding required to wrangle messy clinical data into a manuscript. There also are simply not enough statisticians to meet the needs of medical science. Having clinicians on the front lines with some data science training makes a big difference, whether in 1854 in London (John Snow) or in 2014 in Flint, Michigan (Mona Hanna-Atisha). Having more clinicians with some data science training will impact medical care, as they will identify local problems that would have otherwise never reached a statistician, and probably never been addressed with data otherwise. 1.5 The Scientific Reproducibility Crisis Beginning as far back as 1989, with the David Baltimore case, and increasingly and publicly through the 2010s, there has been a rising tide of realization that a lot of taxpayer-funded science is done sloppily, and that our standards as scientists need to be higher. The line between carelessly-done science and outright fraud is a thin one, and the case can be made that doing science in a sloppy fashion defrauds the funders, as it leads to results that can not be reproduced by the authors nor replicated by others. Particularly in medicine, where incorrect findings can cause great harm, we should take special care to do scientific research which is well-documented, reproducible, and replicable. This topic as a motivating force for doing careful medical research will be expanded upon in Chapter 1. 1.6 Features of a Bookdown electronic book 1.6.1 Icons There are several icons at the top left, to the right of the clickable RMWR link, that can be helpful: 1. The Table of Contents Sidebar - Click on the ‘hamburger’ menu icon (three horizontal lines) or the s key to toggle the sidebar (table of contents) on and off. Within the sidebar, you can click on whichever chapter or subsection you want. 2. This book is Searchable - Click on the magnifying glass or use the f key to toggle the Find box and search for whatever you need to find. 3. You can change the font size, font, and background by clicking on the A icon. 4. You can download the chapter with the download icon (downward arrow into a file tray) in PDF or EPUB formats. 1.6.2 Sharing At the top right, there are several icons for sharing links to the current chapter through social media. 1.6.3 Scrolling/Paging You can scroll up and down within a chapter with your mouse, or use the up and down arrow keys. You can page through chapters with the left and right arrow keys. 1.7 What this Book is Not 1.7.1 This Book is Not A Statistics Text This is not an introduction to statistics. I am assuming that you have learned some statistics somewhere in secondary school, undergraduate studies, graduate school, or even medical school. There are lots of statisticians with Ph.D.s who can certainly teach statistics much more effectively than I can. While I have a master’s degree in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis (isn’t that a mouthful!) from the University of Michigan, I will leave formal teaching of statistics to the pros. If you need to brush up on your statistics, no worries. There are several excellent (and free!) e-books on that very topic, using R. Some good examples include (go ahead and click through the blue links to explore): Learning Statistics with R (LSR) Open Intro Statistics Modern Dive Teacup Giraffes We will cover much of the same material as these books, but with a less theoretical and more applied approach. I will focus on specific medical examples, and emphasize issues (like Protected Health Information) that are particularly important for medical data. I am assuming that you are here because you want to analyze your own data in your (probably) very limited free time. 1.7.2 This Book Does Not Provide Comprehensive Coverage of the R Universe This book is also far from comprehensive in teaching what is available in the R ecosystem. This book should be considered a launch pad. Many of the later chapters will give you a taste of what is available in certain areas, and guide you to resources (and links) that you can explore to learn more and do more beyond the scope of this book. The R computer language has expanded far beyond statistics, and allows you to do many powerful things to improve your workflow, make amazing graphics, and share results with others. 1.8 Some Guideposts Keep an eye out for helpful Guideposts, which look like this: Warnings This is a common syntax error, especially for beginners. Watch out for this. Tips This is a helpful tip for debugging. Try It Out Take what you have learned and try it yourself on your own computer. Challenge - take the next step and try a more challenging example. Try this more complicated example. Explore More - resources for learning more about a particular topic. If you want to learn more about Shiny apps, go to https://mastering-shiny.org to see an entire book on the topic. 1.9 Helpful Tools Throughout this book you will find flipbook code demonstrations and learnr code interactive exercises in which you can practice writing R code right in the book. Let’s explain how to use these demonstration flipbooks and learnr exercises. 1.9.1 Demonstrations in Flipbooks Flipbooks are windows in this book in which you can watch R code being built into pipelines, and see the results at each step. Each flipbook demonstrates some important code concepts, and often new functions in R. You can click on the window to activate it, and the fullscreen (4 arrows) icon to expand it to the full screen. Then use the left and right arrow keys to go forward and back in the code, one step at a time. You will want to go through these slowly, and make sure that you understand what is happening in each step. You may even want to take notes, particularly on the function syntax, as you will likely coding exercises with these functions shortly after the flipbook demonstration. Take a look at the example of a flipbook below. Activate it by clicking on it, and use the expand icon (4 arrows at the lower right) to make it full screen. You can step forward and backward through the pipeline of code with the right and left arrow keys. Watch the results of each step. 1.9.2 Learnr Coding Exercises Learnr coding exercises are windows in this book in which you can write your own R code to solve a problem. Each learnr exercise tests whether you have mastered important code concepts, and often new functions in R. If needed, you can reset to a fresh code window with the Start Over button. You can type lines of code into the window, then click on the Run Code button at the top right to run the code and get your results. Your code may not produce the right result the first time, and you will have to interpret the error message to figure out how to fix it. Rely on the text and your notes and the demonstrations to help you. If you are stuck, you can click on the Hint button to see an example of correct code, and compare it to your own. If you would like, you can even copy this code to the clipboard with the Copy button and Take a look at the example of a learnr exercise below. There is a dataset piped into a series of functions (‘verbs’), with a blank. Fill in the blank with ‘p_vol’ (without the quotes), which stands for the variable, prostate volume. Then run your code with the Run Code button to get a result. Practice using the Start Over button, the Hint button (there may be more than one - usually the last one is the solution), and the Copy To Clipboard button. When you get a table of data as a result from a code pipeline, it may have more columns (variables) than can be displayed easily. When this is the case, there will be a black arrow pointing rightward at the top right of the table of results. Click on this to scroll right and see more columns. A table of data as a result from a code pipeline may also have more rows (observations) than can be displayed easily. When this is the case, the table will be paginated, with 10 rows per page. At the bottom right of the table, there will be a clickable listing of pages, along with Previous and Next buttons. Click on these buttons (or the page number buttons) to see more pages of data to inspect and check your results. 1.9.3 Coding An important note on writing your own code: you should always have an internet search window open when you are writing code. No one can remember every function, nor the correct arguments and syntax of each function. A critical skill in writing code is searching for how to do something correctly. This is not a sign of weakness. Professional programmers google “how do I do x?” many times each day. This is how programming is done. You will often search for things like “how do I do x in R?” or “how to x in tidyverse”. This is completely normal, and to be expected. You do not have time to memorize hundreds of functions, and you may have days or even weeks between coding sessions (because of your day job), making it hard to remember all the details from your last coding session. This is not a problem. There are lots of websites that can help you solve specific problems, as you will find in the How to Find Help chapter.

Don’t worry, I will walk you through this step-by step. 2.1 Goals for this Chapter Install R on your Computer Install RStudio on your Computer Install Git on your Computer Get Acquainted with the RStudio IDE 2.2 Website links needed for this Chapter While in many chapters, I will list the R packages you need, in this chapter, you will be downloading and installing new software, so I will list the links here for your reference. https://www.r-project.org https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ https://git-scm.com/downloads 2.3 Pathway for this Chapter This Chapter is part of the TOOLS pathway. Chapters in this pathway include Getting Started and Installing Your Tools Using the RStudio IDE Updating R, RStudio, and Your Packages Advanced Use of the RStudio IDE When You Don’t Want to Update Packages (Using renv) Major R Updates (Where Are My Packages?) 2.4 Installing R on your Computer R is a statistical programming language, designed for non-programmers (statisticians). It is optimized to work with data in rectangular tables of rows (observations) and columns (variables). It is a very fast and powerful programming engine, but it is not terribly comfortable or convenient. R itself is not terribly user-friendly. It is a lot like a drag racing car, which is basically a person with a steering wheel strapped to an airplane engine. drag racer Very aerodynamic and fast, but not comfortable for the long run (more than about 8 seconds). You will need something more like a production car, with a nice interior and a dashboard, and comfy leather seats. dashboard This equivalent of a comfy coding environment is provided by the RStudio IDE (Integrated Developer Environment). I want you to install both the R statistical language and the RStudio IDE, in that order. Let’s start with installing R. R is free and available for download on the web. Click on the following link to go to the r-project website to get started. This screen will look like this You can see from the blue link (download R) that you can use this link to download R, but you will be downloading it faster if you pick a local CRAN mirror. You might be wondering what CRAN and CRAN Mirrors are. Nothing to do with cranberries, fortunately. CRAN is the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Each site (mirror) in the network contains an archive of all R versions and packages, and the sites are scattered over the globe. A CRAN Mirror maintains an up to date copy of all of the R versions and packages on CRAN. If you use the nearest CRAN mirror, you will generally get faster downloads. At this point, you might be wondering what a package is… A package is a set of functions and/or data that you can download to upgrade and add features to R. It is like a downloadable upgrade to a Tesla vehicle that lets you play the video game Witcher 3 on your console, but more useful. Another useful analogy for packages is that they are like apps for a smartphone. When you buy a new smartphone, it only comes with the basic apps that allow it to work as a phone, and a few other things, like a notepad and a calculator. If you want to do cool things with your smartphone, you download apps that allow your smartphone to have new capabilities. That is what packages do for your installation of R. Now let’s get started. Click on the blue link that says “download R”. This will take you to a page to select your local CRAN Mirror , from which you will download R. cran Scroll down to your local country (yes, the USA is at the bottom), and a CRAN mirror near you. This is an example from the state of Michigan, in the USA. usa-mirrors Once you click on a CRAN Mirror site to select the location, you will be taken to the actual Download site. install Select the link for the operating system you want to use. We will walk through this with Windows first, then Mac. If you are using a Mac, skip forward to the Mac install directions in section 2.6. If you are computer-savvy enough to be using Linux, you can probably figure it out on your own (it will look a lot like these). 2.5 Windows-Specific Steps for Installing R If you are installing R on a Mac, jump ahead to the Mac-specific version below in section 2.6. On Windows, once you have clicked through, your next screen will look like this: install2 You want to download both base and Rtools (you might need Rtools later to build packages). The base link will take you to the latest version, which will look something like this. install3 Click on this link, and you will be able to save a file named R-N.N.N-win.exe (Ns depending on version number) to your Downloads folder. Click on the Save button to save it. install4 Now, go to your Downloads folder in Windows, and double click on the R installation file (R-N.N.N-win.exe). Click Yes to allow this to install. install5exe Now select your language option. install_language You will be asked to accept the GNU license - do so. Click Yes to allow this to install. Then select where to install - generally use the default- a local (often C) drive - we usually do not install on a shared network drive or in the cloud. install_drive Then select the Components - generally use the defaults, but newer computers can skip the 32 bit version. install_components In the next dialog box, accept the default startup options. install_defaults You can choose the start menu folder. The default R folder is fine. install_start If you want a shortcut icon for R on your desktop, you can leave this checked. But most people start RStudio, with R running within RStudio, rather than directly starting R. You can choose to create an R shortcut on your desktop in the next dialog box. You can delete it later if you don’t like it. install_addltasks Then the Setup Wizard will appear - click Finish, and the rest of the installation will occur. install_wizard 2.5.1 Testing R on Windows Now you want to test whether your Windows installation was successful. Can you find R and make it work? This is easy if you chose to make an R shortcut. If not, hunt for your C folder, then for OS-APPS within that folder. Keep drilling down to the Program Files folder. Then the R folder, and the current version folder within that one (R-N.N.N). Within that folder will be the bin folder, and within that will be your R-N.N.N.exe file. Double click on this to run it. The example paths below can help guide you. install_path2 install_path Opening the exe file will open a classic year 2000-era terminal window, called Rterm, with 64 bit if that is what your computer uses. The version number should match what you downloaded. The messaging should end with a “&gt;” prompt. install_term At this prompt, type in: paste(“Two to the seventh power is”, 2^7) (don’t leave out the comma or the quotes) - then press the Enter key. This should produce the following: Two to the seventh power is 128 install_test Note that you have explained what is being done in the text, and computed the result and displayed it. 2.6 Mac-specific Installation of R The installation for Mac is very similar, but the windows look a bit different. If you are working with Windows, jump ahead at this point to Installing RStudio in section 2.7. At the Download Version page, you click on the Mac Download. You will then click on the link for R-N.N.N.pkg, and allow downloads from CRAN. install_path Then go to Finder, and navigate to the Downloads folder. Click on R-N.N.N.pkg You will then click on the link for R-N.N.N.pkg, and allow downloads from CRAN. install_downloadmac Click on Continue on 2 consecutive screens to download cont1_mac cont2_mac Then you need to agree with the License Agreement, mac_license then Click on Install, and provide your Mac password for permission to install. cont1_mac When the installation is complete, click on the Close button. Accept the prompt to move the installer file to the trash. 2.6.1 Testing R on the Mac If you chose to create an R desktop shortcut, double-click on this to start. If not, go to Finder, and then your Applications folder. Scroll down to the R file. Double click on this to run it. findrmac You should get this 2000-era terminal window named R Console. The version number should match what you downloaded, and the messaging should end with a “&gt;” prompt. At this prompt, type in paste(“Two to the seventh power is”, 2^7) (DON’T leave out the comma or the quotes) rconsolemac This should result in mactestR 2.6.2 Successful testing! Awesome. You are now Ready to R! ready2R 2.7 Installing RStudio on your Computer Now that R is working, we will install RStudio. This is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), with lots of bells and whistles to help you do reproducible medical research. teslax_dash This is a lot like adding a dashboard with polished walnut panels, a large video screen map, and heated car seats with Corinthian Leather. Not absolutely necessary, but nice to have. The RStudio IDE wraps around the R engine to make your experience more comfortable and efficient. camry_dash Fortunately, RStudio is a lot cheaper than any of these cars. In fact, it is free and open source. You can download it from the web at: rstudio Click on the RStudio Desktop icon to begin. download This will take you to a new site, where you will select the Open Source Edition of RStudio Desktop open_source This will take you to a new site, where you will select the Free Version of RStudio Desktop free Now select the right version for your Operating syxtem - Windows or Mac. 2.7.1 Windows Install of RStudio If you are installing on a Mac, jump ahead now to the Mac-specfic installation instructions. Now save the RStudio.N.N.N.exe file (Ns will be digits representing the version number) to your downloads folder. winsave Now go to your downloads folder, and double click on the RStudio.N.N.N.exe file. winlaunch Allow this app to make changes. Click Next to Continue, and Agree to the Install Location. wininstall Click Install to put RStudio in the default Start Menu Folder, and when done, click the Finish button. winsave winfinish Now select your preferred language option, accept the GNU license, Click Yes to allow this to install. Select where to install. This is generally on a local (often C:) drive, and usually not a shared network drive or in the cloud. 2.7.2 Testing Windows RStudio Now you should be ready to test your Windows installation of RStudio. Open your Start menu Program list, and find RStudio. Pin it as a favorite now. Click to Open RStudio. Within the Console window of RStudio, an instance of R is started up. Check that the version number matches the version of R that you downloaded. Now run a test at the prompt (“&gt;”) in the Console window. Type in paste(\"Three to the 5th power is\", 3^5) do not leave out the quotes or the comma Then press the enter key and this should be your result: test_result35 A successful result means that you are ready to roll in RStudio and R! 2.7.3 Installing RStudio on the Mac Start at this link: RStudio Download Select the Free RStudio Desktop Version mac_download Then click on the big button to Download RStudio for Mac. mac_download2 After the Download is complete, go to Finder and the Downloads Folder. Double click on the RStudio.N.N.N.dmg file in your Downloads folder. mac_dmg This will open a window that looks like this mac_apps Use your mouse to drag the RStudio icon into the Applications folder. Now go back to Finder, then into the Applications folder. Double click on the RStudio icon, and click OK to Open. Pin your RStudio to the Dock. Double Click to run RStudio. RStudio will open an instance of R inside the Console pane of RStudio with the version number of R that you installed, and a “&gt;” prompt. 2.7.4 Testing the Mac Installation of RStudio Type in paste(\"Three to the 5th power is\", 3^5) do not leave out the quotes or the comma Then press the enter key and this should be your result. test_result35 A successful result means that you are ready to roll in RStudio and R! ready 2.7.5 Critical Setup - Tuning Your RStudio Installation You now have ~ 7 adjustments that you need to make in your RStudio Global Settings for optimal R and RStudio use. At this point, it is a good idea to jump out of RStudio and create an “Rcode” folder on your computer, in a place that is easy to find, often at the top level in your Documents folder, to make all of your future projects easy to find. Once this Rcode folder is in place, switch back to RStudio. In the RStudio Menus, go to Tools/Global Options. A new Global Options window will open up. Click on the General tab on the left. At the top, there is a small window for identifying your Default working directory. Click on the Browse button, and browse to your new “Rcode” folder and select it. From now on, your R files and Projects will all be in one place and easy to find. In the same General tab, de-select the first 3 options turn off Restore most recently opened project at startup turn off Restore previously open source documents at startup turn off Restore .RData into workspace In the same General tab, find Save workspace to .RData on exit. Click on the dropdown menu to select “Never” These tune-ups (#2 and #3) to your RStudio will mean you will always start with a clean workspace in a new RStudio session, which will avoid a lot of potential problems later. In the same General tab, at the top, click on the Advanced tab. Then select the box for Show full path to project in window title This will show your working directory at the top of your Console Pane. This can prevent confusion and problems later. On the left, click on the Rmarkdown tab. Then de-select the option for Show output inline for all Rmarkdown documents. This will put your temporary output from Code Chunks into the larger and nicer Viewer tab. Take a look at the Appearance tab. You can change your code font, the font size, and the theme. I wouldn’t make any drastic changes at this point, but it is good to know that these options are available. Any changes here are entirely optional (and cosmetic) at this point. in the RStudio menus, select Code, then check/select two options to turn these on: Soft Wrap Long Lines - so that your code does not get too wide Rainbow Parentheses - color-codes parentheses so that you can keep track of whether you have closed all of your open parentheses (a common source of errors) Now your RStudio installation is tuned and ready to go! 2.8 Installing Git on your Computer The software program, git, is a version control system. It is the most common version control system in the world. It is free and open source, and is the foundation of reproducible computing. We won’t be doing a lot with git just yet, but it is helpful to get this installation done and out of the way. It will come up a lot when we start to discuss reproducible research and collaboration. 2.8.1 Installing Git on macOS If you are using Windows, jump ahead to Installing Git on Windows. The easiest approach on the macOS is to go to the Terminal tab in the Console pane (lower left) in RStudio. A prompt will appear that ends in a $. At that prompt, type git --version note that there are 2 dashes before version. This will tell you the current version of git (2.29.2 as of January 1, 2021), or prompt you to install git. If you want the current version of git, you can install this yourself. a. First, let’s check if you have homebrew installed. Go to the Terminal tab in the Console pane (lower left) in RStudio. A prompt will appear that ends in a $. at the prompt, type command -v brew This should return “/usr/local/bin/brew” if homebrew is installed, or will tell you “brew not found” or something similar. b. Installing homebrew At the terminal prompt($), paste in the following: /bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot; Then press Enter to run it. This installs the homebrew program, which allows you to install software on macOS that does not come from the Apple App Store This will take a couple of minutes. c. Installing git Once you have homebrew installed, installing git is straightforward. At the Terminal prompt ($), type brew install git and this will quickly install. You will be prompted to click Continue buttons to complete the installation. Check your installation. At the Terminal prompt ($), type git --version and this should return a result like “git version 2.29.2”, depending on the version number. 2.8.2 Installing Git on Windows If you are using Windows, go to the website, https://git-scm.com/download/win. This will start the download automatically Go to your downloads folder and install the downloaded .exe file by clicking on it Check your installation. At the Terminal prompt ($), type git --version and this should return a result like “git version 2.29.2”, depending on the version number. 2.8.3 Installing Git on Linux If you are using Fedora, or a related version of Linux like RHEL or CentOS, use dnf At the $ prompt, type sudo dnf install git-all If you are using a Debian-based version of Linux like Ubuntu, use apt At the $ prompt, type sudo apt install git-all For other distributions of Linux, follow the instructions at https://git-scm.com/download/linux. Check your installation. At the Terminal prompt ($), type git --version and this should return a result like “git version 2.29.2”, depending on the version number. 2.9 Getting Acquainted with the RStudio IDE When you first open the RStudio IDE (Integrated Development Environment), there will be a left side pane, with tabs for Console, Terminal, Rmarkdown, and Jobs. Just for fun, go to the RStudio menus, and choose File/New File/RScript. This will open a new pane at the top left, which we will call the top left pane, or the Source pane. This pane will contain tabs for each active script or document, along with tabs for any datasets you have opened up to have a look at. The Console pane, with tabs for Console, Terminal, Rmarkdown, and Jobs, has now been pushed to the lower left quadrant. You will use the Console for interactive programming, and as a “sandbox” to test out new code. When your code works and is good enough to save, you will move it to the Source pane and save it to a Script or an Rmarkdown document. Any code that is not saved to Source will be lost (actually it will be somewhere in the History, but it can be a pain to find the version that works later - it is best to save the good stuff to a Script or .Rmd). The top right pane includes tabs for your Environment (objects, like datasets, functions, and variables you have defined), History (saving the past in case you forget to, but messy), and Connections tabs for connections to databases. Later a Git tab will be added for version control (backup) of your Source documents. The bottom right pane contains tabs for your Files, Plots, Packages, Help, and a Viewer for HTML output. This is material that is also well described in the “Basic Basics 1” section of RLadiesSydney. Check it out at Basic Basics 1. There is a nice ~ 15 minute video by Jen Richmond worth watching if you are just getting started. Note that a lot of the other material on this website (RYouWithMe) is very helpful for getting started with R.

At the end of this chapter, you will publish your data analysis to RPubs, a free website site where you can share your data analyses and visualizations. 3.2 Goals for this Chapter Set up an RPubs account Open a New Rmarkdown document Read in Data from a file Wrangle Your Data Visualize Your Data Publish your work to RPubs Check out Interactive Plots Check out Animated Graphics Check out a Clinical Trial Dashboard Check out a Shiny App 3.3 Packages needed for this Chapter In this chapter, we will use the following R packages: tidyverse janitor rstatix medicaldata If you have not installed these packages on your computer already, we will walk you through installation after you open your Rmarkdown document (see below). 3.4 Website links needed for this Chapter In this chapter, you will need to access the RPubs website. https://rpubs.com/ 3.5 Setting up RPubs First you will need to set up a free account on RPubs. Start by opening a new tab in your browser, and navigating to this link RPubs link. It should look like the image below. Enter your name, email, username and password, (remember these, you will need them later) and click on the Register Now button, and you will be set up to use RPubs . This will bring you to this page. In the image below, we have set up an account for pdr. Click on the Here’s How You Get Started link (blue text). You are now all set up and ready to go. Now you have a place on the internet to share your R creations. On to the creation part! 3.6 Open a New Rmarkdown document Let’s get started in R. Turn on your computer, and open the RStudio application. You should see the familiar panes for the Console, Environment, and Files. You need to open up a new document to activate the Source pane. While in RStudio, click on File/New File/RMarkdown. It should look like this. Opening a New Rmarkdown Document Now you will see the window below. Rename the document from “Untitled” to “Tasting”. Enter your own name as the Author, and click the OK button. Adding Title and Author Now the file is open, and looks like the window below (with title “Tasting” and author “Peter Higgins”. Click on the save icon (like a floppy disk in the top left), and save this document as my_data_analysis.Rmd. What Your New Rmarkdown Document Looks Like You have created a new Rmarkdown document. An Rmarkdown document lets you mix data, code, and descriptive text. It is very helpful for presenting and explaining data and visualizations. An Rmarkdown document can be converted (Knit) to HTML for a web page, or to Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, PDF, and several other output formats. artwork by Allison Horst, @allison_horst Code chunks are in a gray color, and both start and end with 3 backticks (```), like this. code goes here Text can be body text, or can be headers and titles. The number of hashtags before some header text defines what level the header is. You can insert links, images, and even YouTube videos into Rmarkdown documents if it is helpful to explain your point. You can change the way that the Rmarkdown document is displayed with two buttons in the top right of the new Tasting document tab. The button with several horizontal lines that looks like an outline can be clicked to toggle an outline pane on and off. When the outline pane is on, you can click on the entries to go to a different part of your document quickly. The button that looks a bit like an Angstrom symbol (A with a circle on top), or perhaps it looks like a compass to you, allows you to turn on Visual Editing, or WYSIWIG (what you see is what you get) visual editing. When this is off, you can see the markdown codes that make the words “R Markdown” a level 2 header (right after the setup chunk), with two hashtags right before the text. But when the Visual Editing button is turned on, you can see the formatting as it will appear in the output document, and a new formatting bar appears at the top of the document below the Knit button. This formatting bar adds the ability to select text and change the heading level (top left), or make text bold, italic, underlined, etc. The formatting bar also lets you insert images, links, and tables into your document, much like you would with a word processor. The first code chunk in each Rmarkdown document is named setup. Find this code chunk in your “Tasting” document. The code chunk name (in this case, setup) comes after the left curly brace and the r ({r) at the beginning of the each code chunk. The letter r tells RStudio that what is coming on the next line is R code (RStudio can also use SQL, C++, python, and several other commputer languages). After a comma, you can define options for this code chunk. In the case of this setup chunk, the option include is set to FALSE, so that when this Rmarkdown document is knitted, this code chunk will run, but no output or warnings or messages will appear in the output document. 3.7 Knitting your Rmarkdown document While this is just an example template, you can see that there is some explanatory text, some formatting, and two code chunks. One code chunk has the option, echo = FALSE, which means that the code in that code chunk will not appear in the output document, but the results of the code chunk will appear. To see what the output of this Rmarkdown document looks like, click on the Knit button - this is at the top center of your Tasting document next to a blue ball of yarn with a knitting needle. When you knit the Rmarkdown document, the default result is an HTML output document. Notice that you can see the code for the cars code chunk, but that the setup code chunk and pressure code chunk do not appear. But you do get results: a summary of the cars dataset and a plot of the pressure data. You also have the option of knitting Rmarkdown documents to other kinds of output, including Microsoft Word, Microsoft Powerpoint, posters for medical meetings, books (like this book), and pdf documents. 3.7.1 Installing Packages Before we begin working on your Rmarkdown document, you will need to install a few R packages on your computer. Go to your Console tab (lower left in RStudio), and type in (or copy and paste in) the following 5 lines: install.packages(&#39;tidyverse&#39;) install.packages(&#39;janitor&#39;) install.packages(&#39;rstatix&#39;) install.packages(&#39;remotes&#39;) remotes::install_github(&#39;higgi13425/medicaldata&#39;) Press Enter to run these functions. These will install the 5 packages, {tidyverse}, {janitor}, {rstatix}, {remotes}, and {medicaldata}. Installing packages is like buying apps for your phone. But these apps are not loaded into your current R session unless you tell R and RStudio that you want them loaded in the current session. You do this with the library() function. 3.7.2 Loading Packages with library() Copy and paste to add the following 5 lines to your setup chunk in your “Tasting.Rmd” Rmarkdown document: library(tidyverse) library(janitor) library(rstatix) library(medicaldata) prostate &lt;- medicaldata::blood_storage %&gt;% clean_names() These functions will load 4 packages and read in data from a study of prostate cancer and blood storage into the prostate object. Now run these functions, by clicking on the green rightward arrow at the top right of the setup code chunk in your Rmarkdown document. The installation of the {tidyverse} package (it is actually a meta-package that contains multiple packages) will be quite chatty, telling you which packages are being attached, and when conflicts with identically-named functions in the {stat} package have occurred. When you call the functions, filter() and lag(), the versions from the {tidyverse} package will be used by default, and the versions from the {stats} package will be masked. The {janitor} package will tell you that it has 2 conflicts with the {stats} package, and will supercede (mask) the {stats} functions for chisq.test() and fisher.test(). If you really want to access the versions from the {stats} package, you can do so by using the package::function construction, e.g. stats::chisq.test(), which tells R that you want to use the version of the function from the {stats} package, rather than the {janitor} package. If you check the Environment tab in the top right pane of RStudio, you will find that you now have a prostate object under the Data header. You can click on the white-on-blue arrow to the left of the word prostate to get an overview of each variable, the variable type (numeric, string, etc.), and the first few values of each variable. You can also click on the word prostate in the Environment window to open up a View of the whole dataset in the Source pane (top left). You can scroll up and down the rows, or right and left in the columns to inspect the data. If you check the Console tab (lower left), you will see that when you clicked on prostate, this sent a function to the console to View(prostate). You can view any dataset in the Environment tab with this function. You can also look at your data in the Console, by running (type in and press Enter for each line) glimpse(prostate) summary(prostate) to provide some information on the contents of the prostate dataframe, and a summary of the data. 3.8 Your Turn to Write Text Underneath the setup chunk, change the text of the first header (“R Markdown”) to “Analysis of Prostate Data”. Now delete the next two paragraphs of Normal text and write something about the prostate dataset, based on the summary in the console . You write body text for your documents in Normal text, and you can add new headers by starting a line with 2 hashtags, a space, and text like this ## Headline about Prostate data Write a few sentences after your heading. You can add italics or bold text by wrapping the text to be highlighted in underscores or 2 asterisks, respectively. If you are using the Visual Editor mode, you can do these things more easily by selecting your text, and clicking on the bold or italic icons in the formatting bar. You can also change a line of text to a header by selecting it, then clicking the dropdown arrow next to the word “Normal” at the top left of the formatting bar. You can make this into one of 6 levels of Headings, or a code chunk. We often reserve the level 1 Heading for the title. Try adding some text and formatting to your text. 3.9 Wrangle Your Data Find the {r cars} code chunk. Edit the name “cars” to “wrangle” Delete the one line of code from the template - “summary(cars)” We will replace this with a few lines of code to improve the data in the prostate dataset. We will be modifying the prostate dataset (with the mutate function), particularly the variables aa and fam_hx into properly labeled categorical variables, called factors in R. Then we will save (assign) the result to the prostate_factors object, while retaining the previous version in the prostate object. Copy the lines of code below and paste them into the new wrangle code chunk. You can see in the code that we start with the prostate dataset, and then (the pipe symbol [%&gt;%] is read as “and then”) mutate the aa variable to a labelled factor, and then mutate the fam_hx variable to a labelled factor. Then the resulting dataframe is assigned to the new prostate_factors object. This version of the data will be helpful for plotting later. prostate %&gt;% mutate(aa = factor(aa, levels = c(0,1), labels = c(&quot;White&quot;, &quot;African-American&quot;))) %&gt;% mutate(fam_hx = factor(fam_hx, levels = c(0,1), labels = c(&quot;No Family History&quot;, &quot;FHx of Prostate Cancer&quot;))) -&gt; prostate_factors Note that R will not ask you if you want to over-write an object. This is just a reminder to be careful when you assign data to an object. You don’t want to re-use an object name (like prostate) and inadvertently over-write your previous work. It is fine if this is what you intended, but make sure it is that this is you want to do. It is generally a good practice to assign data to well-named objects, so that you know what they are, where they came from, and how they have changed since the last data wrangling iteration. It is generally not a good idea to over-write your data. 3.10 Summarize Your Data Now you will Insert a new R code chunk, after the wrangle chunk. First, click with your mouse to place your cursor on a blank line below the wrangle chunk. Now open a new code chunk. To do this, find the green code (C) button in the menu bar at the top of your Rmarkdown document. Click on it and select R as the language being used. You will get a gray code chunk with the {r} label at the top. Insert your cursor after the r, and before the closing brace. Add a space, then type the name, summarize. In this chunk, we will run some code to summarize three variables. Paste the four lines of code below into your new code chunk. prostate %&gt;% select(age, p_vol, preop_psa, aa, fam_hx) %&gt;% group_by(aa, fam_hx) %&gt;% summarize(across(age:preop_psa, mean, na.rm=TRUE)) This code starts with the prostate dataset, and then selects 5 of the variables. Then it groups the observations by African-American race and Family history of prostate cancer. Then it summarizes across 3 variables to get the mean value of each one (after removing any missing values). Try this out by clicking on the rightward green arrow at the top right of your summarize code chunk. This should produce a summary table of results for age, prostate volume, and preoperative PSA. Add some body text below the code chunk, with your interpretation of these results, and some hypotheses about these summary results, including the contrasts by family history and race. Depending on the sample size, some of these differences might be statistically significant. Which ones would you like to test? 3.11 Visualize Your Data Now let’s plot the prostate_factors data. Change the name of the previous plot chunk to \"visualize\". Delete the one line of code from the example. We will produce a scatterplot, faceted by African-American race and Family History. Copy and paste the code below into your Rmarkdown document in this visualize code chunk. ggplot(prostate_factors) + aes(x = p_vol, y = preop_psa, col = aa) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) + facet_grid(aa ~ fam_hx) + labs(x = &#39;Prostate Volume&#39;, y = &quot;Preoperative PSA&quot;, title = &#39;Relationship Between Prostate Volume and Preop PSA,\\nSubdivided by Family History and Race&#39;) + theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) This will run the code to generate a plot. Note that these steps for a ggplot are connected with + signs, while the data wrangling steps are connected with the pipe ( %&gt;% ) symbol. Let’s walk through each step of the code. First you are stating the dataset to plot, with ggplot(prostate), and then the aesthetic mappings are stated, with p_vol mapped to x, preop_psa mapped to y, and the aa variable mapped to color. This all happens in the aes(x = p_vol, y = preop_psa, col = aa) step. Then these are plotted as scatterplot points with geom_point, and linear regression lines are added with geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") (method = “lm” is for linear model). Then the plot is faceted (broken into comparison plots) by the aa and fam_hx variables with facet_grid(aa ~ fam_hx). Then labels for x and y and the title are added. Then a theme option is used to move the legend position to the bottom. You can run the visualize code chunk and see the plot by clicking on the green arrow at the top right of the code chunk. Do you think that the slopes of the linear regression lines are all the same? Are there differences or patterns? Add some text below your plot stating your interpretation of these plots, and any hypotheses generated by this visualization of the data. 3.12 Statistical Testing of Differences Based on the previous summary, it looks like the African-American patients in this dataset may have, on average, a higher preoperative PSA level. We can test this with Student’s t test. Insert a new header for Statistical Testing (or T testing). Make sure it is in the Heading 2 format. Then insert some Normal text in which you state your hypothesis. Then insert a code chunk (green C button, select the R language). Name this new code chunk “t-test”. Paste in the three lines of code below to get the results of a t test comparing preop_psa levels between African-Americans and Whites in this dataset. prostate_factors %&gt;% t_test(formula = preop_psa ~ aa, detailed = TRUE) Now write some body text below the results, with your interpretation for this result in this dataset and sample size. 3.13 Publish your work to RPubs Now you have a complete data analysis, including data wrangling, summarizing, plotting, and statistical testing. Your report combines code, results, graphics, and text introduction of the questions, and text interpretation of the results. Go ahead and Knit this Rmarkdown document to see the final result. Use the Knit button (blue ball of yarn with knitting needle) near the top left of your Rmarkdown document. Now you can share this document with others, by publishing your results and interpretation on the web. Now that you have a knitted HTML document, look for the Publish button at the top right of the HTML output (it looks sort of like a blue eye, or two blue semicircles wrapped around a blue dot). Click on this and select RPubs. The knitted HTML document will now be uploaded to RPubs, and your result can be found at https://rpubs.com/username, based on your RPubs username. You may have to click on the username dropdown at the top right to reach View Profile, which will show the documents that you have published. Click on the thumbnail of your new document to go to the full link and see it in its full HTML glory. This page will have a specific link, which will be something like at [[https://rpubs.com/username](https://rpubs.com/username/123456)](https://rpubs.com/username)/123456 , which is a dedicated link you can share with other people who want to see your results. You can share this link via email, and anyone (collaborators, mentors, friends) can see your results report from anywhere with a web connection. You did it! You should feel like an Rmarkdown rock star! artwork by Allison Horst, @allison_horst You can also knit Rmarkdown documents to: Microsoft Word (1st draft of manuscript) Microsoft Powerpoint (1st draft of presentation) Posterdown (a poster-making package - for meeting posters) so that you don’t need to copy/paste your results or plots, and you can easily re-run your analyses and produce new outputs if you get more data. This chapter should give you a taste of the powerful tools for research reproducibility in R that can make your research work more efficient and more reproducible. 3.14 The Dessert Cart Below are some examples of more neat things you can do with medical data in R. These are more advanced approaches, but completely doable when you have more experience with R. 3.14.1 Interactive Plots Below is an interactive plot. Click on the plot to activate it. Then you can hover your mouse over each point to get more details about the data. You can also use the crosshairs to draw a zoom rectangle, or use the plotly menu bar at top right to zoom in or out of a region of the data. 3.14.2 Animated Graphics Here is an example of animated graphics that you can create in R to illustrate changes in data over time. 3.14.3 A Clinical Trial Dashboard Below is an screen capture picture of a web flexdashboard to track the data in an ongoing clinical trial (which is now completed and published). You can see the actual web dashboard here. Check out the various tabs. Imagine how useful it would be to track enrollment, exclusions, missing data, and outcomes in real time. Details on how this is done can be found here, and the underlying code here. All of this work was done in R by Jenn Thompson. 3.14.4 A Shiny App The frame below shows a publicly available Shiny web application, built with R, which can help clinicians calculate the probablity of intestinal TB vs. Crohn’s disease with available clinical data. And to determine how new test results would change this estimate. The web app can be accessed here. 3.14.5 An Example of Synergy in the R Community One of the remarkable things about the open source R community is that people build all kinds of new R functions and packages that are useful to them, and then share them publicly with tools like Github so that they can be useful to others. Often combining bits of several packages leads to emergent properties - completely new creations that can only occur because all of the parts (packages) are present. The collaborative nature of the R community, in this case on Twitter (follow the #rstats hashtag), can lead to surprising collaborations and outcomes. Go ahead and play the example below, which uses rayrendering (all coded entirely in R) to show a 3D map of John Snow’s cholera case data in 1854, which led him to identify the Broad Street water pump as the source of the cholera outbreak, and led to the removal of the pump handle and the end of outbreak. If you are not familiar with John Snow and the Broad Street pump, there is a fun series of YouTube animations (parts 1-3 and an epilogue) to explain the history. Start by clicking here.

You will often want to focus your analysis on particular observations, or rows, in your dataset. This chapter will show you how to include the rows you want, and exclude the rows you don’t want. The main function in the tidyverse for doing this is filter(). The filter() function uses logical statements, or conditions, to decide whether to keep or exclude rows in your dataset. Figure 4.1: Artwork by Allison Horst, https://www.allisonhorst.com 4.1 Goals for this Chapter Understand logical statements Filter rows based on numeric values Filter rows based on string values and regex Filter rows based on dates Combine filters with boolean logic symbols, like AND (&amp;) and OR(|) Filter on missing (NA) values Filter rows for duplicates/distinct observations Slicing rows based on row number/position Sampling rows as random samples 4.2 Packages needed for this Chapter {tidyverse} {lubridate} {medicaldata} 4.3 Pathway for this Chapter This Chapter is part of the DATA WRANGLING pathway. Chapters in this pathway include What is Tidy Data? Filtering Rows Counting, Grouping, and Summarizing Rows Arranging and Ranking Rows Selecting Columns Mutating to Make New Variables Rearranging Untidy data with {tidyr} and {pivotr} 4.4 Logical Statements in R Logical statements in R are important for defining something that is TRUE or FALSE for each row, or observation, in your data. A typical logical statement involves a variable, and some criteria to test each observation of that variable, resulting in a TRUE or FALSE for each row. Typical examples of logical statements include: sbp &gt; 140 troponin_i &gt; 9.0 creatinine &gt;= 2.5 gfr &lt;= 60 Each of these examples tests each row in the database with the stated criterion, and results in a vector of TRUE or FALSE values for each row (observation) of the variable in the logical statement. The filter() function will act on these TRUE and FALSE values to include (TRUE) or exclude (FALSE) the observations from the result. 4.5 Filtering on Numbers - Starting with A Flipbook This flipbook will show you step-by-step examples of how to filter rows of observations based on logical statements involving numbers. In each logical statement, a variable will be compared with a numeric value via a mathematical operator. These operators can include comparisons with greater than (&gt;) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) less than (&lt;) less than or equal to (&lt;=) equal to (==) notice two equals signs to test equality near() - an equality test that works with tiny decimal differences The general format for filter statements is: filter(variable [comparison operator] value), like filter(sbp &gt; 140) will keep only rows with systolic blood pressure values greater than 140. If you have not used a flipbook before, you can click on the frame below to activate it, then use the right and left arrow keys to move forward and back through the examples. With each forward step in the code on the left, examine the resulting output on the right. Make sure you understand how the output was produced. In many of the examples, a select() function is used to reduce the number of columns before the filter() step to make the results more clear. You saw several examples of filtering, including Example Code equality to a value filter(recurrence == 1) greater than a value filter(preop_psa &gt; 20) near a value filter(near(preop_psa, 10)) near a value with a set tolerance filter(near(preop_psa, 17, tol = 1.5)) between 2 values filter(between(preop_psa, 10, 13)) in a list of values filter(preop_psa %in% c(10,13,17)) 4.5.1 Your Turn - learnr exercises Try this out yourself, with interactive coding exercises below, written with the {learnr} package. For each exercise, you can type in the code required,by the instructions, then click on the blue Run Code button at the top right of the exercise to test your code. Watch out for a red x in the left margin - that identifies a coding error - hover over it for an explanation of what is wrong. If you get stuck, you can click on the Hint button to get a hint, and if needed, the Copy Clipboard button to copy the hint so that you can paste it into the Exercise box. 4.6 Filtering on Multiple Criteria with Boolean Logic You can use multiple filters on your data, and combine these with the boolean symbols AND (symbol &amp;) OR (symbol | ) - the vertical line, often on the keyboard above the backslash character ( \\ ) XOR - exclusive OR, so that the whole logical statement is true if either statement A is true, or statement B is true, but NOT if both are true. parentheses and combinations thereof. NEGATION - an exclamation point ( ! ) placed before an equals sign or a variable in a logical statement makes it mean the opposite. and you can use parentheses as well, to control the order of operations. You saw several examples of filtering, including Example Code AND filter(age &gt; 65 &amp; t_vol&gt;1) OR filter(age &gt; 69 | t_vol &gt; 1) exclusive OR (XOR) filter(xor(age &gt; 69, t_vol &gt; 1)) AND with negation (!) filter(age &gt; 64 &amp; aa != 1) 4.6.1 Your Turn - learnr exercises Try this out yourself, with interactive coding exercises below, written with the {learnr} package.

Watch out for a red x in the left margin - that identifies a coding error - hover over it for an explanation of what is wrong. If you get stuck, you can click on the Hint button to get a hint, and if needed, the Copy Clipboard button to copy the hint so that you can paste it into the Exercise box. 4.7 Filtering Strings You can use == to test exact equality of strings, but you can also use str_detect from the {stringr} package for more flexible matching, and combine it with the magic of regex (regex ~ Regular expressions) to do complicated filtering on character string variables in datasets. The typical formats for string filtering are filter(variable == “string”) for an exact match, or filter(str_detect(variable, pattern = “string”)) [note two parentheses at the end to completely close the parentheses with str_detect] You saw several examples of filtering strings, including Example Code matches “oma” filter(str_detect(diagnosis, “oma”)) negated match filter(!str_detect(diagnosis, pattern = “Hodgkin”)) regex for wild card filter(str_detect(diagnosis, pattern = “lympho.+ic”)) regex wild card filter(str_detect(diagnosis, “myelo.*”)) exact match filter(diagnosis == “myelofibrosis”) 4.7.1 Your Turn - learnr exercises Try matching strings yourself, in the interactive coding exercises below, written with the {learnr} package. For each exercise, you can type in the code required,by the instructions, then click on the blue Run Code button at the top right of the exercise to test your code. Watch out for a red x in the left margin - that identifies a coding error - hover over it for an explanation of what is wrong. If you get stuck, you can click on the Hint button to get a hint, and if needed, the Copy Clipboard button to copy the hint so that you can paste it into the Exercise box. 4.8 Filtering Dates You can use the {lubridate} package to format strings for logical tests, and filter your observations by date, month, year, etc. Dates are commonly formatted in ISO 8601 format, or YYYY-MM-DD, for 4-digit year, 2-digit month, and 2-digit day. The {lubridate} package can convert these to dates if the ymd() function is applied to a string formatted this way. The typical formats for date filtering are filter(date == ymd(“2002-10-06”)) for an exact match, or filter(between(datevar, ymd(“2020-01-01”, ymd(“2020-06-30”)) filter(datevar &gt; today() - years(1)) for the past year &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Updated upstream You saw several examples of filtering dates, including Example Code between 2 dates filter(between(fake_date, ymd(“2020-03-01”), ymd(“2020-03-31”) 24 months prior to today filter(fake_agvhd_date &gt; today() - months(24)) filter to weekdays 1 or 7 (weekend) filter(wday(fake_bmt_date) %in% c(1,7)) 4.8.1 Your Turn - learnr exercises Try matching dates yourself, in the interactive coding exercises below, written with the {learnr} package. For each exercise, you can type in the code required,by the instructions, then click on the blue Run Code button at the top right of the exercise to test your code. Watch out for a red x in the left margin - that identifies a coding error - hover over it for an explanation of what is wrong. If you get stuck, you can click on the Hint button to get a hint, and if needed, the Copy Clipboard button to copy the hint so that you can paste it into the Exercise box. 4.9 Filtering Out or Identifying Missing Data You can use the is.na(), drop_na() and negation with ! to help identify and filter out (or in) the missing data, or observations that are incomplete. Common formats for this include is.na(variable) - filters for observations where the variable is missing !is.na(variable) - filters for observations where the variable is not missing janitor::remove_empty(“rows”) - removes completely empty rows (helpful if you are importing a messy dataset) drop_na() - without filter, this drops any observations with at least one NA value in the row. drop_na(variable1, variable2) - without filter, this drops any observations with at least one NA value iin the variable1 or variable2 columns. 4.9.1 Working with Missing data A common need when doing DEV (Data Exploration and Validation) is to find your missing datapoints, so that you can figure out why they are missing, and whether you can fix this using other records, including the medical record. Another common scenario, when you can’t find or fix missing data, is that you want to drop observations which are missing in a particular variable. Sometimes you will need to drop whole empty rows, which usually happens because of poor formatting of the data (often in a spreadsheet). Sometimes you will need to drop observations that have missing data in any field, which is important in modeling. Linear and logistic models generally only run on complete cases, where all predictors and outcomes are non-missing. You can also impute missing data points, if there are not too many (&lt;10%), and these are truly missing completely at random (MCAR), which is often not the case. Usually there is a bias, so that particular types of study participants have more missing data than others. The packages {missForest} and {mice} can be helpful for imputation when MCAR assumptions are met. Imputation is beyond the scope of this chapter, and should generally be done in consultation with a statistician, as the assumptions involved are very important. You saw several examples of filtering missing data, including Example Code filtering for the missing observations in a variable fi lter(is.na(fake_date)) filter for the non-missing data in a variable filter (!is.na(fake_dx_date)) removing empty rows remove_empty(“rows”) removing incomplete cases drop_na() 4.9.2 Your Turn - learnr exercises 4.10 Filtering Out Duplicate observations You can use the distinct() function and the {janitor} package to help you find duplicated observations/rows for fixing or removal from your dataset. Common formats for this include distinct(dataset) - filters for rows that are distinct from all the other rows (non-duplicates). janitor::get_dupes(dataset) - filters for observations that are duplicated in all variables, counts them, and displays them in duplicated groups. You saw several examples of filtering duplicate data, including Example Code distinct observations distinct(dataset) finding duplicates get_dupes(dataset) making the complementary dataset dataset_whole %&gt;% anti_join(data_subset) 4.11 Slicing Data by Row You can use the slice() family of functions to cut out a chunk of your observations/rows by position in the dataset.. Common formats for this include slice(X:Y) - filters for rows X to Y by position (row number). slice_max(variable, n = N) - filters for observations with the maximum N values for a single variable. slice_min(variable, prop = 0.0N) - filters for observations with the minimum proportion of 0.0N values for a single variable. slice_head and slice_tail - filter for observations by position in the top (or bottom) N or top/bottom proportion. You saw several examples of slicing data, including Example Code slice by position slice(100:200) slice by top values in variable slice_max(age, n=20) slice by bottom values in variable slice_min(pan_day, prop = 0.01) slice by top or bottom position slice_tail(prop = 0.01) 4.12 Randomly Sampling Your Rows You can use the slice_sample() function to take a random subset of large datasets, or to build randomly selected training and testing sets fo modeling. Common formats for this include slice_sample(prop = 0.N) - randomly samples N % of your rows. slice_sample(n = N) - randomly samples N of your rows. You saw several examples of sampling data, including Example Code sampling a proportion slice_sample(prop = 0.3) sampling N rows slice_sample(n = 50) 4.12.1 Your Turn - learnr exercises 4.13 Further Challenges Try filtering on your own computer.

Let’s start with a table of the most common error messages, and the likely cause in each case. Note that when reading an error message, there are two parts - the part before the colon, which identifies in which function the error occurred, and the part after the colon, which names the error. A typical error message is usually in the format: Error in Where the error occurred : what the error was here is an example Error in as_flextable(.) : object 'errors' not found On the left, you are being told that the error occurred when the as_flextable() function was called. This can be helpful if you have run a long pipeline of functions, as it helps you isolate the problem. On the right, you are being told what the error was. In this case, the function looked for the object errors in the working environment (see your Environment tab at the top right in RStudio), and could not find it. Note that sometimes syntax errors caused by missing components (a missing comma, a missing parenthesis, a missing pipe symbol %&gt;% , or a missing + sign in a ggplot pipe) will cause an error in the next function in the pipeline. Watch out for this, especially when the function where the error is found looks fine - often it occurs because there is a missing piece just before this function. Then we will walk through examples of how to create each error, and how to fix them, one by one. 5.1 The Common Errors Table Examine the error message from R, particularly the part that comes after the colon (:). The error messages listed in the left column will be what appears after the colon (:) Common Error Messages in R Error Message What it Means could not find function This usually means that you made a typographical error in the function name (including Capitalization - R is case-sensitive), or that the package you are intending to use (which contains the function) is not installed - with `install.packages(‘package_name’)` or the package is not loaded - with `library(package)` object ‘object-name’ not found This usually means that the function looked for an object (like a data frame or a vector) in your working environment (check your Environment pane) and could not find it. This commonly happens when you mistype the name of the object (double-check this, easy to fix), or you did not actually create or save this object to your working environment - confirm by checking your Environment tab at the top right in RStudio. filename does not exist in current working directory (‘path/to/working/directory’) This usually means one of three things: you mistyped the name of the file, or part of the path, you are not in the directory where the file is, or the file you thought you had saved does not exist (check your Files tab in the lower right pane in RStudio). error in if This usually means that you have an *if* statement that is trying to make a branch-point decision, but the logical statement that you wrote is not providing either a TRUE or a FALSE value. The most common reasons are typographical errors s in the logical statement, or an NA in one of the underlying values, which yields an NA from the logical statement. You may need to use a `na.rm = TRUE` option in your logical statement (the na.rm issue often comes up with means and medians). error in eval This usually occurs when you are trying to run a function on an object that does not exist in your environment. Check to make sure in your Environment pane, and consider that you may not have saved/assigned the object in a previous step. Alternatively, you may have a typographical error in the object name. Worth checking. cannot open This usually occurs when you are attempting to access or read a file that either does not exist, or is not in the folder that you thought it was. Check your working directory and find the file in your file structure. This can often be prevented by working in RStudio projects and using the here() function for paths to files. no applicable method This usually occurs when you are using a function that expects a particular data structure (vector, list, dataframe), but you have given it a different data structure as the input. Check the data structure of your object, and check the documentation for your function. For example, if you want to use a function that acts on vectors, this function will not work on a dataframe object. You may have to use the `pull(variable)`function to “pull” this variable out of the dataframe into a vector before using this function. subscript out of bounds you are trying to access an item in an environment object (like a vector, dataframe, or list) that does not exist, like the 9th item in a vector that is 7 items long, or the negative 2nd row of a dataframe. Check the length of the item, and the math that you used to count the item number (loops that go too long are often a culprit) replacement has [x] rows, data has [y] rows This usually occurs when you are trying to code for a new variable, or replace a variable in a dataframe. But somehow (missing values, NAs), what you are trying to add to the dataframe is not the same length (number of rows) as the rest of the existing dataframe. Use a length() function to check your building of this vector at each step, to figure out where your length went wrong. package not available for R version x.y.z This occurs when you are trying to install a package, and your R version is newly updated. The problem is that the package version available on CRAN has not caught up to your shiny new version of R. This can happen after an R update when the package developer is working on updating their package, but the new version has not made it onto CRAN yet. This is often fixable if you know where the developer stores their development code (usually on GitHub). For example, if the package is {medicaldata}, and the developer’s Github userid is higgi13425, then you can install the development version of this package with remotes::install_github('higgi13425/medicaldata'). This assumes that you have already installed and loaded the {remotes} package. non-numeric argument to a binary operator A binary operator, like + or *, is a mathematical operation that takes two values (operands) and produces another value. It gets grumpy when trying to do math on things that are not numbers. A typical input to produce this error would be 1 + 'one' - one operand is numeric, and the other 'one' is a character string - the non-numeric argument. object of type closure is not subsettable This occurs when you try to extract a subset of something - but it is actually a function, not an object. This most commonly occurs when you try to subset a particular object that does not exist, like df$patient_id or data$sbp, when you have not created the objects df or data. The reason you get this strange error message, rather than simply Error: object 'df' not found , is that df() and data() are defined functions in base R. It is good practice to avoid naming any objects data or df for this reason. It gets very confusing, and this is best avoided. 5.2 Examples of Common Errors and How to fix them 5.2.1 Missing Parenthesis This is a very common error. It is easy to lose track of how many sets of parentheses you have open in putting together a complicated function. Here is an example, where a closing parenthesis is missing from a mutate() function. prostate %&gt;% select(t_vol, p_vol, age, aa) %&gt;% mutate(ratio = t_vol/p_vol, older_aa = case_when(age &gt;65 &amp; aa == 1 ~ 1, TRUE ~0) %&gt;% filter(older_aa ==1) In this case, no output is produced, and the console does not return to the &gt; prompt. Instead, it offers a + prompt - in effect, asking you for something more. If you type in an extra closing parenthesis (after the filter function), it will give you an error. The error you get is: Error: Problem with `mutate()` input `older_aa`. x no applicable method for ‘filter_’ applied to an object of class “c(‘double’, ‘numeric’)” ℹ Input `older_aa` is ``%&gt;%`(…)`. R identifies a problem with the input “older_aa” to mutate - the parentheses are not closed. It then fails on the next function - filter, and gives you a strange error message - filter_ applied to… - because the input to the filter step (the next step after the error) was incoherent. This can be a bit confusing. But if you inspect the input older_aa, you will find the mis-matched parentheses. This is much easier to find with “rainbow parentheses” turned on in Tools/Global Options. When this option is on, you can be sure your parentheses are right when you end on red. Sometimes the very thin parentheses of some fonts can make it difficult to identify your red close parenthesis. The red vs. yellow parentheses may be easier to differentiate if you use a bold font for your code. You can change this with RStudio Tools/Global Options/Appearance. I am currently using FiraCode-Bold and the Crimson Editor theme in RStudio, which seems to help me. In this case, adding the missing parenthesis to the mutate step fixes it. Parentheses that end on red are all right. 5.2.2 An Extra Parenthesis What if you go the other way, with an extra parenthesis after some misguided copy-paste adventures? Let’s see what happens. prostate %&gt;% select(t_vol, p_vol, age, aa) %&gt;% mutate(ratio = t_vol/p_vol, older_aa = case_when(age &gt;65 &amp; aa == 1 ~ 1, TRUE ~0))) %&gt;% filter(older_aa ==1) In this code block, you will end up with two red closing parentheses, and when you click to the right of the final closing parenthesis, there will be no matching highlighted open parenthesis (note that the preceding closing parentheses both have matching highlighted open parentheses. Both of these are clues that this last one is an extra. The error you get from R is Error in filter(older_aa == 1) : object ‘older_aa’ not found The left side of the error message identifies the filter step as where the error occurs, and the right side of the error message states that the error is an object not found. The error occurs when R gets to the next function. It also tells you that older_aa was not successfully created - suggesting that the problem is in the step before the filter function. In this case, removing the extra parenthesis from the mutate step fixes it. 5.2.3 Missing pipe %&gt;% in a data wrangling pipeline This is a common error. It is easy to cut out one of your %&gt;% connectors when you are editing/debugging a data wrangling pipeline. Here is an example, where a %&gt;% is missing. Can you spot it? prostate %&gt;% select(t_vol, p_vol, age, aa) mutate(ratio = t_vol/p_vol, older_aa = case_when(age &gt;65 &amp; aa == 1 ~ 1, TRUE ~0)) %&gt;% filter(older_aa ==1) In this case, the error you get is: Error in mutate(ratio = t_vol/p_vol, older_aa = case_when(age &gt; 65 &amp; aa == : object ‘t_vol’ not found The left side of the error message identifies the mutate step as where the error occurs, and the right side of the error message states that the error is an object not found. This is a bit misleading, as the problem is not in the mutate step. But mutate is where the pipeline crashes, as it can not find the variable t_vol. You have to backtrack upwards line-by-line to find the error. Every line of a data wrangling pipeline should end in %&gt;%. Since this is such a common error, this should be one of your “usual suspects”. And the select line, just above the mutate line, is where the problem is. In this case, adding the missing %&gt;% to the end of the select step fixes your data wrangling pipeline. Use one function per line in a pipeline. Check every data wrangling pipeline to make sure each step (except the last) ends in a pipe %&gt;% 5.2.4 Missing + in a ggplot pipeline This is a common error. It is easy to cut out one of your + connectors when you are editing/debugging a ggplot. Here is an example, where a + is missing in the middle of a ggplot pipeline. prostate %&gt;% select(t_vol, p_vol, age, aa) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = factor(t_vol), y =p_vol)) geom_boxplot() + labs(x = &quot;tumor volume&quot;, y = &quot;prostate volume&quot;) + theme_minimal() In this case, you get a ggplot output, but without any boxplots. It is also missing your custom labels for the x and y axes, and the theme you wanted. Essentially, the code stops running after the initial ggplot() statement and the remaining lines of code are ignored. This can be pretty puzzling, as you do get a plot, but not what you intended. There is a partial plot in the Plots tab, but you get a somewhat helpful error in the Console. The error you get is: Error: Cannot add ggproto objects together. Did you forget to add this object to a ggplot object? R identifies a problem with the last 3 lines of code, starting with geom_boxplot() - it can not add these ggproto objects (the components of a ggplot) to the existing plot. It asks, “Did you forget to add?” which should be a clue that there is a missing + sign between lines of ggplot code. Since the theme and labels are the defaults, and there are no boxplots, suggest that these last 3 lines were not run at all, and that the missing plus sign should be found just before these lines of code. In this case, adding the missing + to the end of the ggplot step fixes your plot. Use one function per line in a pipeline. Check every ggplot pipeline to make sure each step (except the last) ends in a plus sign + 5.2.5 Pipe %&gt;% in Place of a + This is a common error. It is easy to start with your dataset, do some data wrangling steps with the pipe %&gt;% and keep piping out of habit, even after you start your ggplot. Unfortunately, once you start to ggplot, you have to use + as your code connector. Having a pipe instead will cause an error. Here is an example, where a %&gt;% is used instead of + in a ggplot pipeline. It usually happens at the beginning of the ggplot, when you are still in piping mode. prostate %&gt;% select(t_vol, p_vol, age, aa) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = factor(t_vol), y =p_vol)) %&gt;% geom_boxplot() + labs(x = &quot;tumor volume&quot;, y = &quot;prostate volume&quot;) + theme_minimal() In this case, you will not get a ggplot output, and you will get an error in the console. The error you get is: Error: `mapping` must be created by `aes()` Did you use %&gt;% instead of +? The error message identifies the aes() step as where the error occurs. R identifies a problem that causes the aes function to fail to create a mapping. The first line is not very helpful (other than identifying aes() as a problem), but in the next line, R asks, “Did you use %&gt;% instead of +?” which is very helpful. Once you know this, look at the line where aes() failed. This is where there is a pipe in place of a plus. In this case, replacing the %&gt;% with a + fixes your plot. 5.2.6 Missing Comma Within a Function() This is a common error. It is easy to start a series of arguments to a function, like multiple variables in a mutate step, and miss a comma between them. Here is an example, where a comma is missing in a series of mutate steps. Note that it is a good habit to put one mutate step on each line, with each line ending in a comma. This will help you find the missing comma if (no, when) you make this mistake. prostate %&gt;% select(t_vol, p_vol, age, aa) %&gt;% mutate(ratio = t_vol/p_vol, older_aa = case_when(age &gt;65 &amp; aa == 1 ~ 1, TRUE ~0) age_decade = floor(age / 10)) %&gt;% filter(older_aa ==1) In this case, you will not get a tibble output, and you will get an error in the console. The error you get is: Error in filter(older_aa == 1) : object ‘older_aa’ not found The left side of the error message identifies the filter step as where the error occurs, and the right side of the error message states that the error is an object not found. R identifies a problem that causes the filter function to fail, but this is actually a problem in the line prior. The variable older_aa was not created and is not available to filter. It should have been created in the mutate step, but this step is where the failure occurred. Because you formatted the mutate step with one mutate statement per line, it is easy to check each line for a comma - and the older_aa line is missing its comma. In this case, adding a comma at the end of the older_aa line (after “TRUE ~0)” fixes your data wrangling pipeline. 5.2.7 A Missing Object This is a common error. You may have created or modified a dataframe, but forgot to assign it to a new object name. Or maybe you did this assignment in a different session, but have not done it in your current session. Or maybe you made a typographical error in calling the object (“covvid” instead of “covid”). Either way, this object is not yet loaded into your computing environment (the Environment tab). In this example, we request data from the {medicaldata} package, but forget to assign it to an object. So it does not exist when we try to use it to start a pipeline. This does not work. medicaldata::covid_testing covid %&gt;% select(subject_id, age, result, ct_result, patient_class) %&gt;% mutate(high_titer = case_when(ct_result &lt; 18, TRUE ~ 0), age_decade = floor(age / 10)) %&gt;% filter(age &gt;50) In this case, you will not get a tibble output, and you will get an error in the console. The error you get is: Error in select(., subject_id, age, result, ct_result, patient_class) : object ‘covid’ not found The portion to the left of the comma identifies where the error occurs - in the select step. The portion to the right of the comma identifies the error. This one is easy. The object ‘covid’ was not found. You can check your Environment pane, and it will not be there. What the coder intended was to call medicaldata::covid_testing and assign it (with an arrow) to a new object named covid. But that assignment did not happen, and R is unable to guess what you meant. In this case, adding an assignment arrow -&gt; to the end of the medicaldata::covid_testing line and then covid completes the assignment, creates the covid object, and fixes your data wrangling pipeline. 5.2.8 One Equals Sign When you Need Two This is a very common error. The equals sign is commonly used in two ways in R. To assign a parameter or argument of a function, like x = p_vol, or ratio = p_vol/t_vol, or color = “blue”. In all of these assignment cases, you use one equals sign. To test a logical statement, like age == 60, or fam_hx == 1, or location == “Outpatient”. In all of these logical tests, you use two equals signs. It is very common to use one equals sign in a logical statement. This causes errors. Watch the last filter step below. prostate %&gt;% select(t_vol, p_vol, age, aa) %&gt;% mutate(ratio = t_vol/p_vol, older_aa = case_when(age &gt;65 &amp; aa == 1 ~ 1, TRUE ~0), age_decade = floor(age / 10)) %&gt;% filter(older_aa ==1) In this case, the error you receive is very helpful: Error: Problem with `filter()` input `..1`. x Input `..1` is named. ℹ This usually means that you’ve used `=` instead of `==`. ℹ Did you mean `older_aa == 1`? The problem is with the filter step. The error starts out very jargon-y. “input `..1`. x Input `..1` is named” - means the input to filter is actually named (an assignment). But then it gets a lot more helpful. It recognizes that you have made a common error, and suggests an appropriate fix. In this case, adding a 2nd equals sign in the filter step fixes your data wrangling pipeline. Testing for equality with == is a big problem with real numbers, rather than integers. Computers use algorithms to do math which are not quite exact, leading to small differences in decimals. The == equality test is very strict, so that something like sqrt(2)^2 == 2 is FALSE because of small differences far to the right of the decimal point, which can trip you up. You can see these if you run the modulo 2: sqrt(2)^2 %% 2, which gives you the remainder after you divide by 2, which is the very tiny 0.0000000000000004440892. In this situation, you should use the near() function, as near(sqrt(2)^2, 2) is TRUE. The near function has a built-in tolerance of 0.00000001490116, which will be able to handle any computer-generated small, stray decimals. You can set your own tolerance argument if needed. 5.2.9 Non-numeric argument to a binary operator This happens when you try to do math on things that are not numbers. It usually occurs when you have a variable(column) that looks like it is numeric (it contains numbers), but somewhere along the way it became a character string variable. This often occurs when data are being entered into a spreadsheet, and one value in the column has characters in it. This often happens when you have a column of systolic blood pressures, and one value is entered as “this was not done”, or “102, but taken standing up”. Having comments, even if only one character string in a column in Excel makes the whole column into the character string data type. This is not apparent until you try to do math with this variable, as in data %&gt;% mutate(mean_art_pressure = sbp/3 + 2/3* dbp) This will give you the error: Error in mutate(mean_art_pressure: non-numeric argument to binary operator To fix this, you will have to Determine which variable, sbp or dbp, is non-numeric (glimpse(data) will help). Review the values of the problem variable (possibly with table()) to find which is non-numeric. Fix these values manually in your code, and document with comments Which values are being fixed (e.g. sbp for subject 007, at visit 2) data$sbp[subject == 007 &amp; visit == 2] &lt;- 102 What the original value was, and what the new value will be Who made the change to the data Why the data change was made On what date the data change was made Never over-write your original data - keep a complete audit trail! 5.3 Errors Beyond This List This is where the internet comes in handy. Whatever errors you can create, someone has already run into. And they have asked for help on the internet, and most of the time, someone has helped them solve their error. You should copy your entire error message, and paste it into a web search. Google will often yield multiple similar examples, with various ways to solve the problem. In a future chapter, we will explore more effective ways to seek help, using a minimal reprex to describe your problem accurately to other people on sites like community.rstudio.com. Remember that the error may have occurred because of a problem in the previous line of code (missing parenthesis, comma, etc.), so don’t forget to check one line above. The Add-One-Line debugging strategy is another good strategy. Select the code for your pipeline from the beginning to 2 lines of code before the error. If that runs without errors, add one line to your selection, and run it. Keep adding lines to your selection and running until you hit the error. Then try to find the problem and fix it. 5.4 When Things Get Weird 5.4.1 Restart your R Session (Shift-Cmd-F10) If you are running code that has worked before, and it is not working now, it is possible that you have created something odd in your working Environment that is interfering with your code. Sometimes it is an old object from a previous session (it is always better to start from a clean slate). Completely restart your R session (click on Session/Restart R, or use the keyboard shortcut), make sure the Environment is clean, then run your code from start to finish to give it a new try. Sometimes a clean slate will make all the difference. 5.5 References: These are some helpful general references on troubleshooting in R, particularly focused on error messages encountered by beginners to R.

The functions and packages of base R are stable and slow to change (unlike the dynamic packages and functions of the tidyverse), and many are helpful and important building blocks for using R. Some of the functions in base R tend to fail silently, and have unhelpful error messages, but they are embedded in a lot of R scripts. When you search for help with R on websites like RStudio Community and Stack Overflow, you will often find base R code, and you will need to know how to interpret it. There are many really basic and important functions in base R that are worth knowing about. Once you have a handle on these basic functions, you can say Obscure base R / video game meme meme details 6.1 Dimensions of Data Rectangles Whether you have a data.frame, a tibble, or a matrix, it can be helpful to know the dimensions of what you have. You can get at these dimensions with dim() nrow() ncol() You may want to know how many rows to loop over, or how many columns need names, but you will frequently need to access these numbers. The dim() function returns two numbers - the rows first, then the columns. Let’s try this on the licorice dataset from the {medicaldata} package. dim(licorice) ## [1] 235 19 This is great, as long as you know that the first number is the number of rows, and the 2nd number is the number of columns (standard notation is R x C, so rows first, columns second). But if you want to get the number of rows out, and store it in a variable, you need to use the brackets [n] notation. Brackets allow you to pull out the nth item in a vector or a list. Let’s pull out the first item (the number of rows), and the second item (the number of columns) separately. We will store these in the 2 variables rows and columns, then print them out. rows &lt;- dim(licorice)[1] rows ## [1] 235 columns &lt;- dim(licorice)[2] columns ## [1] 19 You can also do this more directly with the nrow() and ncol() functions. rows &lt;- nrow(licorice) rows ## [1] 235 columns &lt;- ncol(licorice) columns ## [1] 19 A similar approach can give you the length of a vector with the length() function. Here we will check the length of the treat vector in the licorice tibble. length(licorice$treat) ## [1] 235 The length() function works a bit differently on dataframes or tibbles - it returns the number of variables/columns. This can be surprising if you don’t expect it, and you are expecting the number of rows. length(licorice) ## [1] 19 6.2 Naming columns Sometimes you want to take a quick look at the names of all of you columns in a dataframe. The names() function is a quick solution. names(licorice) ## [1] &quot;preOp_gender&quot; &quot;preOp_asa&quot; ## [3] &quot;preOp_calcBMI&quot; &quot;preOp_age&quot; ## [5] &quot;preOp_mallampati&quot; &quot;preOp_smoking&quot; ## [7] &quot;preOp_pain&quot; &quot;treat&quot; ## [9] &quot;intraOp_surgerySize&quot; &quot;extubation_cough&quot; ## [11] &quot;pacu30min_cough&quot; &quot;pacu30min_throatPain&quot; ## [13] &quot;pacu30min_swallowPain&quot; &quot;pacu90min_cough&quot; ## [15] &quot;pacu90min_throatPain&quot; &quot;postOp4hour_cough&quot; ## [17] &quot;postOp4hour_throatPain&quot; &quot;pod1am_cough&quot; ## [19] &quot;pod1am_throatPain&quot; You can also use names() to re-set the names if you want to change a bunch of column names, by assigning a vector of names (of the same length). names(licorice) &lt;- c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;S&quot;) licorice[1:10, ] ## A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S ## 1 0 3 32.98 67 2 1 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 2 0 2 23.66 76 2 2 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 3 0 2 26.83 58 2 1 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 4 0 2 28.39 59 2 1 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 5 0 1 30.45 73 1 2 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 6 0 2 35.49 61 3 1 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 7 0 3 25.50 66 1 1 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 8 0 2 31.10 61 2 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 9 0 3 21.22 83 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 10 0 3 27.16 69 2 3 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Note that you can use the set_names() function in the {purrr} package to conveniently change variable/column names within a data pipeline, and the rename() function in the dplyr package to change particular variable/column names. licorice %&gt;% purrr::set_names(1:19) %&gt;% dplyr::rename(&quot;purple&quot; = 2) %&gt;% # note rename(new_name = old_name) tibble() ## # A tibble: 235 x 19 ## `1` purple `3` `4` `5` `6` `7` `8` `9` ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0 3 33.0 67 2 1 0 1 2 ## 2 0 2 23.7 76 2 2 0 1 1 ## 3 0 2 26.8 58 2 1 0 1 2 ## 4 0 2 28.4 59 2 1 0 1 3 ## 5 0 1 30.4 73 1 2 0 1 2 ## 6 0 2 35.5 61 3 1 0 1 3 ## 7 0 3 25.5 66 1 1 0 1 3 ## 8 0 2 31.1 61 2 1 0 1 1 ## 9 0 3 21.2 83 1 1 0 1 1 ## 10 0 3 27.2 69 2 3 0 1 2 ## # … with 225 more rows, and 10 more variables: 10 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 11 &lt;dbl&gt;, 12 &lt;dbl&gt;, 13 &lt;dbl&gt;, 14 &lt;dbl&gt;, 15 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 16 &lt;dbl&gt;, 17 &lt;dbl&gt;, 18 &lt;dbl&gt;, 19 &lt;dbl&gt; licorice[1:10, ] ## A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S ## 1 0 3 32.98 67 2 1 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 2 0 2 23.66 76 2 2 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 3 0 2 26.83 58 2 1 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 4 0 2 28.39 59 2 1 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 5 0 1 30.45 73 1 2 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 6 0 2 35.49 61 3 1 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 7 0 3 25.50 66 1 1 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 8 0 2 31.10 61 2 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 9 0 3 21.22 83 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 10 0 3 27.16 69 2 3 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Note also that we used the bracket notation above to print just the first 10 rows of the renamed version of the licorice dataframe. This was done with brackets that define which [rows, columns] we want to use (in this case for printing). By using the sequence 1:10, we choose the first 10 rows. By putting nothing after the comma, we select all columns. You might be wondering why the column names reverted to alphabetical letters after we used set_names to change them to numbers. This is because we did set the names, and printed the result out to the console, but did not assign the result back to the licorice object with an assignment arrow, so it is transient, rather than a lasting change to the licorice object. This is a common pitfall for beginners. We can use also use brackets to choose exactly which rows and columns we want. licorice[4:7, c(2,5,10)] ## B E J ## 4 2 2 0 ## 5 1 1 0 ## 6 2 3 0 ## 7 3 1 0 Here we have selected 4 particular rows with a sequence (4:7), and 3 particular columns (by concatenating these into a vector with the c() function). 6.3 Concatenation One of the simplest, but most common early functions in R is c(). The c() function concatenates items together into a vector. This can be helpful for building a vector of items to iterate over, or to build a vector which will become a variable in a dataframe, or even a vector of options for a function. You simply write the items, separated by commas, in order inside the parentheses of c(). Remember that strings need to be enclosed in matching quotes. fib_numbers &lt;- c(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34) fruit_vec &lt;- c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;coconut&quot;, &quot;dragonfruit&quot;, &quot;elderberry&quot;) fib_numbers ## [1] 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 fruit_vec ## [1] &quot;apple&quot; &quot;banana&quot; &quot;coconut&quot; &quot;dragonfruit&quot; ## [5] &quot;elderberry&quot; 6.4 Sequences There are times when you want to create a sequence of numbers (i.e. 1 to 10, or 1 to 100), without manually concatenating a vector. The easiest way to do this is with the colon (:). You can assign 1:12 to an object, or 77:83, if you prefer. 1:12 ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 77:83 ## [1] 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 6.5 Constants Note that base R has some handy constants that may help in making vectors - LETTERS (vector of letters (string) from A to Z) - letters (vector of letters (string) from a to z) - month.abb (vector of 3 letter (English) month abbreviations from Jan to Dec) - month.name (vector of 3 letter (English) month abbreviations from January to December) - pi (the irrational number for relating diameter to circumference) You can select subsets of these with the bracket notation, i.e letters[1:13]. You can also format number for printing as strings with sprintf() (for print formatting) to include the desired number of decimals. LETTERS[7:12] ## [1] &quot;G&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;J&quot; &quot;K&quot; &quot;L&quot; letters[5:10] ## [1] &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; month.abb[10:12] ## [1] &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Dec&quot; pi %&gt;% sprintf(fmt = &quot;%1.5f&quot;, .) ## [1] &quot;3.14159&quot; 6.6 Fancier Sequences You can make more complex sequences with the seq() function. The main arguments (parameters) of seq() are from (default =1) to (default =1) by (default = (to-from)/length) length You will generally need at least 3 of these to describe a sequence, or seq() will use the default by value of 1. Note that if the by increment does not match the to argument, the sequence will stop at the last number before the to number. seq_len(n) is a shortcut that gives you a sequence from 1 to n, while seq_along(vector) is a shortcut that gives you a sequence from 1 to the length of a the vector. See the examples below # leaving out &quot;length&quot; seq(from = 2, to = 18, by = 2) ## [1] 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 # leaving out argument names seq(3, 18, length=6) ## [1] 3 6 9 12 15 18 # &#39;length&#39; and &#39;to&#39; do not match seq(from = 24, to = 4, by = -6) ## [1] 24 18 12 6 # leaving out &quot;to&quot; seq(from = 5, by = 5, length = 6) ## [1] 5 10 15 20 25 30 # leaving out &quot;by&quot; seq(from = 16, to = 128, length = 8) ## [1] 16 32 48 64 80 96 112 128 seq(from = 51, by = -3, length = 17) ## [1] 51 48 45 42 39 36 33 30 27 24 21 18 15 12 9 6 3 # using the seq_len() shortcut with n seq_len(14) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 # using the seq_along() shortcut with a vector seq_along(7:23) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 seq_along(licorice$C) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 ## [14] 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 ## [27] 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 ## [40] 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 ## [53] 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 ## [66] 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 ## [79] 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 ## [92] 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 ## [105] 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 ## [118] 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 ## [131] 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 ## [144] 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 ## [157] 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 ## [170] 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 ## [183] 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 ## [196] 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 ## [209] 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 ## [222] 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 ## [235] 235 6.7 Mathematical functions R has many mathematical functions, which can be used in a variety of calculations. These can be run on a vector, or on a variable in a dataframe. These include (and there are many more): mean median var sd min max range rank sum Examples are shown below mean(1:20) ## [1] 10.5 median(licorice$C) ## [1] 25.91 var(licorice$C) ## [1] 18.24933 sd(licorice$C) ## [1] 4.271923 min(licorice$C) ## [1] 15.6 max(licorice$C) ## [1] 36.33 range(licorice$C)[2] # selects 2nd value in range (max) ## [1] 36.33 rank(licorice$C)[1] # ranks first 10 values ## [1] 225 sum(licorice$C) # sum of values ## [1] 6013.99 6.8 Handling missing data (NAs) R designates missing values as the symbol NA (not available). NAs propagate through calculations, so that if you have a vector with at least one NA, and you try to calculate the mean, it will return NA. mean(licorice$J) ## [1] NA You can handle this within many functions (including mean, median, sd, and var) with the argument na.rm = TRUE. The default for these is na.rm = FALSE, so that if you are trying to do an operation on missing data, R will tell you. na.rm is an argument in a number of mathematical functions, in which na comes first, followed by the verb rm (remove). Testing whether a value or values are missing (NA) is in the reverse order. You use the is.na() function, in which the verb comes first, and then followed by NA. You might reasonably think that you can just use a normal equality test for NA values, like licorice$J == NA ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## [19] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## [37] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## [55] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## [73] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## [91] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## [109] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## [127] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## [145] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## [163] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## [181] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## [199] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## [217] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## [235] NA but, because NAs propagate, you get just NAs, rather than TRUE or FALSE. You can use is.na() for this. licorice$J %&gt;% is.na() ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [10] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [19] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [28] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [37] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [46] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [55] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [64] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [73] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [82] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [91] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [100] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [109] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [118] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [127] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [136] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [145] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [154] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [163] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [172] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [181] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [190] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [199] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [208] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [217] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [226] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [235] FALSE There are a few TRUEs in there (value is NA), but they can be hard to count. The sum() function can help, when combined with is.na(). The which() function can help you figure out which values are missing. The anyNA() function can tell you if there are any missing values in a vector (or a variable/column in a dataframe). licorice$J %&gt;% is.na() %&gt;% sum() ## [1] 2 licorice$J %&gt;% is.na() %&gt;% which() ## [1] 113 123 licorice$C %&gt;% anyNA() ## [1] FALSE licorice$J %&gt;% anyNA() ## [1] TRUE There are two missing values, in rows 113 and 123. The na.omit() function can remove all of the rows(cases, observations) from a dataframe that have at least one missing value in any column. This can be helpful for modeling, in which cases with missing data can cause problems. It is helpful to keep track of the number of rows before and after na.omit(), to know how many cases/observations/rows you are discarding. nrow(licorice) ## [1] 235 licorice %&gt;% na.omit() %&gt;% # modeling would happen here if not too many cases discarded nrow() ## [1] 233 Note that this can also be done in the tidyverse with drop_na() in the {tidyr} package. You can include a particular column or columns as an argument in drop_na() to only drop observations if there are missing values in these particular columns. licorice %&gt;% drop_na(H:J) %&gt;% nrow() ## [1] 233 The code above takes the licorice dataset, looks for NA values in rows of (only) columns H through J, and drops 2 rows based on missing data, reducing the number of rows from 235 to 233. 6.9 Cutting Continuous data into Levels While there are good arguments for why not to do this (dichotomania, loss of granularity in data), it is common to cut continuous data into levels, like (mild, moderate, severe), or (normal weight, overweight, obese). This can, when there are already established standard levels, make the data easier to interpret. The cut() function in base R makes this easy to do. C_factor3 &lt;- cut(licorice$C, breaks = 3) table(C_factor3) ## C_factor3 ## (15.6,22.5] (22.5,29.4] (29.4,36.4] ## 59 130 46 str(C_factor3) ## Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;(15.6,22.5]&quot;,..: 3 2 2 2 3 3 2 3 1 2 ... This creates a new variable (C_factor), which is a factor with 3 levels. The levels are stored as 1, 2, 3, and range from 15.6-22.5 for 1, above 22.5-29.4 for 2, and above 29.4 to 36.4 for 3. The interval notation uses the square bracket for including the listed number, and parentheses for starting just after the listed number. It is a good practice to develop a standard way of naming these created variables, which are related to the original variable, are factors, and have a certain number of levels. One helpful shorthand is to take the original variable name, and to add the suffix “_f4\" for a factor with 4 levels. A dichotomized variable would be \"varname_f2” "],["updating-r-rstudio-and-your-packages.html", "Chapter 7 Updating R, RStudio, and Your Packages 7.1 Installing Packages 7.2 Loading Packages with Library 7.3 Updating R 7.4 Updating RStudio 7.5 Updating Your Packages", " Chapter 7 Updating R, RStudio, and Your Packages 7.1 Installing Packages The most important way to update R is to add packages. Each package adds new functions and/or data to R, enabling you to do much more in the R and RStudio environment. When you open R, or start a new session, you have only the base version of R available, and it is pretty spartan. You can see how many packages you have available to you by starting RStudio and going to the menu Session/New Session, or Session/Restart R. Each of these will give you a clean workspace to start in. Once you have started a new session, or restarted R, run the following code: print(.packages()) You will find that you only have 9 packages available, including base, utils, methods, stats, graphics, grDevices, datasets, devtools, and usethis. This is what is called “base R” and is essentially the bare minimum needed to use R. In order to use more of the power of R and RStudio, you will need to install packages (a one-time task), and load them (in each session) before use with a library(package_name) function. If you Google a bit for ways to do things in R, you will find many packages that can be helpful. The most strictly validated packages are hosted on CRAN - a mirrored server. There are now over 20,000 packages on CRAN to do various specialized things in R. These were all useful for someone, so they have shared them on CRAN. To install packages from CRAN, you use the function: install.packages(\"package_name\") Notice that the package_name has to be in quotes. These can be single or double quotes. The package_name and install.packages() are case_sensitive like all objects and functions in R, so that something like Install.Packages will not work. Once the package is installed, you keep that in your R library associated with your current major version of R. You will need to update &amp; reinstall packages each time you update a major version of R. R versions are designated with R version #.#.# A change in the third number indicates a minor version change. A change in the first or 2nd number (from R 3.6.2 to 4.0.0, or 4.0.2 to 4.1.0) is a major version upgrade which will require re-installation of packages. Let’s practice installing a package. Run the code below to install the tidyverse package. install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) 7.1.1 Installing Packages from Github Some packages are still in development. These are often in repositories on github, rather than on the CRAN servers. To install these packages, you need to know path to the repository. You can install the medicaldata package from Github. Run the code below to install this package. devtools::install_github(&quot;higgi13425/medicaldata&quot;) In contrast to install.packages, the library() function can work with quotes around the package_name, but they are not required. This is because these packages are already installed in your R library, and are known quantities. In general, known objects in your R environment do not require quotes, and novel things like packages do require quotes. If you re-run print(.packages) at this point, you will not have any more packages. This is because you have installed new packages, but not loaded them. 7.1.2 Problems with Installing Packages 7.1.2.1 R Version Issues Sometimes you may run into a problem installing a package which was developed for a previous version of R. Especially if you have recently upgraded your R version recently, the CRAN version of a package may be a bit behind. This can often be fixed by googling for “github” and “package_name”. This will usually lead you to the github repository for that package, which will have a pathname of “github_username/package_name”. Once you know this, you can use devtools::install_github('github_username/package_name') to install the newest version of the package, which will usually be compatible with the latest version of R. 7.1.2.2 Installing from Source vs Binaries 7.1.2.3 Dependencies Some packages are dependent on specific versions of other packages, and will ask you to update the other packages during installation. As a general rule, you should say ‘yes’ to all packages. If you are worried about over-writing an existing package in a way that would break your code in a different project, then that project needs its own project-specific library, which you can create with the {renv} package. 7.1.2.4 Extra-R Dependencies Sometimes packages require (depend upon) software that is not part of the R ecosystem. These will generally give you messages during the install process asking you to install this helper software. Common helper software includes things like Fortran and RJava. Sometimes you will need to go to websites, or use software like Homebrew (on the Mac) to install these extra helper pieces of software. A bit of googling will usually help with the specific package requirements. 7.2 Loading Packages with Library Run the code chunk below to load both {tidyverse} and {medicaldata}. Note that the {tidyverse} package is actually a meta-package that contains 8 packages, and each one has its own version number. library(tidyverse) library(medicaldata) Notice that loading tidyverse led to some conflict messages. The dplyr::filter function masks the stats::filter() function. These two packages, {dplyr} and {stats}, both have a function named filter(). The more recently loaded package is assumed to be the default, so if you call a filter() command, R will use dplyr::filter(). If you want to call the stats::filter() command, you have to explicitly use the package::function() format. If you are not sure which package you loaded last, it can be wise to use the explicit format when calling functions in R. The other masked function is lag(). The function dplyr::lag() is masking stats::lag(), as {dplyr} was loaded after {stats}. Most of the time this is not a big difference, but every once in a while a conflict between package functions can get very confusing. When in doubt, use the explicit format, in which you call package::function() to make clear what you mean, as in dplyr::lag() vs. stats::lag(). Note that it is good practice to load all of your packages needed for an R script or an Rmarkdown (.Rmd) document at the beginning of the script or .Rmd. This allows someone else using your script or Rmd to check whether they have the needed packages installed, and install them if needed. In an Rmarkdown document, this is done in a special setup code chunk near the top of the document. If some of these packages are not on CRAN, it is good practice to add a comment (a statement after a hashtag) on how to install this package. For example, in a setup chunk that loads {tidyverse} and {medicaldata}, it is a good idea to add a comment on how to install {medicaldata}, which is not yet on CRAN. See the example below library(tidyverse) library(medicaldata) # the {medicaldata} package can be installed with remotes::install_github(&#39;higgi13425/medicaldata&#39;) 7.3 Updating R Every once in a while, you will want to update your version of R. Usually this occurs with a major version upgrade, when something important changes. You may not rush into this, as it means re-installing all of your packages, but eventually it is worth it to be up to date. In order to update R, you have to find your installed version of R and run it on its own, outside of RStudio. This is easy if you have an R desktop shortcut, but not too hard if you hunt around a bit in your Applications folder. Double click the R icon to start up R. It will open the R Console and a menu. Click on the R menu at top left, and select Check for R Updates. If you are up to date, the R Console will report “Your version of R is up to date”. If not, this process will provide windows and buttons to click to upgrade to the latest version of R. When done, quit R and start RStudio to make sure the update has carried over. You should see the new version number when RStudio starts. 7.4 Updating RStudio To update RStudio, just run RStudio, and go to the Help menu in the top menu bar (not the Help tab in the lower right quadrant). In the Help menu, select Check for Updates. It will tell you if you are using the latest version of RStudio, or will direct you to the website to download the latest version. 7.5 Updating Your Packages To update your packages, you go to the Tools menu in RStudio, and select Check for package updates. You will usually get a list of the packages that have been updated since you installed them. Generally, select Update All, and allow one restart of your R session. RStudio may ask you if you want to restart more than once, but always say no after the first session restart. You may be asked about installing some packages from source, and you should generally select Yes. In general, your Console pane will be a bit chatty as it documents all the steps in package installation, but should generally end with something like: “The downloaded source packages are in ‘/private/var/folders/93/s18zkv2d4f556fxbjvb8yglc0000gp/T/RtmpHnsvlh/downloaded_packages’” and return to your &gt; prompt. If you then re-check for Package Updates, you will get the message that all of your packages are up to date. This process is a bit different after a major version upgrade of R, which we will cover in a later chapter. You have to retreive a list of all your packages, decide which to keep, and then install these fresh in the new version of R (and its new, major-version-specific package library).

These outcomes can be measured with dichotomous outcomes like death or hospitalization, but continuous outcomes like systolic blood pressure, endoscopic score, or ejection fraction are more commonly available, and provide more statistical power, and usually require a smaller sample size. There is a tendency in clinical research to focus on dichotomous outcomes, even to the point of converting continuous measures to dichotomous ones (aka “dichotomania”, see Frank Harrell comments here), for fear of detecting and acting upon a small change in a continuous outcome that is not clinically meaningful. While this can be a concern, especially in very large, over-powered studies, it can be addressed by aiming for a continuous difference that is at least as large as one that many clinicians agree (a priori) is clinically important (the MCID, or Minimum Clinically Important Difference). The most common comparison of two groups with a continuous outcome is to look at the means or medians, and determine whether the available evidence suggests that these are equal (the null hypothesis). This can be done for means with Student’s t-test. Let’s start by looking at the cytomegalovirus data set. This includes data on 64 patients who received bone marrow stem cell transplant, and looks at their time to activation of CMV (cytomegalovirus). In the code chunk below, we group the data by donor cmv status (donor.cmv), and look at the mean time to CMV activation (time.to.cmv variable). Run the code (using the green arrow at the top right of the code chunk below) to see the difference in time to CMV activation in months between groups. Try out some other grouping variables in the group_by statement, in place of donor.cmv. Consider variables like race, sex, and recipient.cmv. Edit the code and run it again with the green arrow at the top right. # insert libraries in each chunk as if independent library(tidyverse) library(medicaldata) cytomegalovirus %&gt;% group_by(sex) %&gt;% summarize(mean_time2cmv = mean(time.to.cmv)) -&gt; summ summ ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## sex mean_time2cmv ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0 13.7 ## 2 1 12.7 That seems like a big difference for donor.cmv, between 13.7303333 months and 12.7441176 months. And it makes theoretical sense that having a CMV positive donor is more likely to be associated with early activation of CMV in the recipient. But is it a significant difference, one that would be very unlikely to happen by chance? That depends on things like the number of people in each group, and the standard deviation in each group. That is the kind of question you can answer with a t-test, or for particularly skewed data like hospital length of stay or medical charges, a Wilcoxon test. 9.1 Common Problem Comparing two groups Mean or median vs. expected Two arms of study - independent Pre and post / spouse and partner / left vs right arm – paired groups Are the means significantly different?

This is critical for planning, as you may find out very quickly that a reasonable study budget and timeline will be futile. Grant funding agencies will be very interested in whether you have a good rationale for your proposed sample size and timeline, so that they can avoid wasting their money. Fortunately, the {pwr} package helps with many of the needed calculations. Let’s first install this package from CRAN, and load it with a library() function. Remember that you can copy each code chunk to the clipboard, then paste it into your RStudio console (or a script) to edit and run it. Just hover your mouse pointer over the top right corner of each code chunk until a copy icon appears, then click on it to copy the code. install.packages(&#39;pwr&#39;) library(pwr) The {pwr} package has a number of functions for calculating sample size and power. Functions in the {pwr} package Test Sample Size Function one-sample, two-sample, and paired t-tests pwr.t.test() two-sample t-tests (unequal sample sizes) pwr.t2n.test() two-sample proportion test (unequal sample sizes) pwr.2p2n.test() one-sample proportion test pwr.p.test() two-sample proportion test pwr.2p.test() two-sample proportion test (unequal sample sizes) pwr.2p2n.test() one-way balanced ANOVA pwr.anova.test() correlation test pwr.r.test() chi-squared test (goodness of fit and association) pwr.chisq.test() test for the general linear model pwr.f2.test() Now that you have {pwr} up and running, we can start with a simple example. 10.1 Sample Size for a Continuous Endpoint (t-test) Let’s propose a study of a new drug to reduce hemoglobin A1c in type 2 diabetes over a 1 year study period. You estimate that your recruited participants will have a mean baseline A1c of 9.0, which will be unchanged by your placebo, but reduced (on average) to 7.0 by the study drug. You need to calculate an effect size (aka Cohen’s d) in order to estimate your sample size. This effect size is equal to the difference between the means at the endpoint, divided by the pooled standard deviation. Many clinicians can estimate the means and the difference, but the pooled standard deviation is not very intutitive. Sometimes you have an estimate from pilot data (though these tend to have wide confidence intervals, as pilot studies are small). In other circumstances, you can estimate a standard deviation for Hgb A1c from values from a large data warehouse. When you don’t have either of these, it can be helpful to start by estimating the range of values. This is something that is intutitive, and experienced clinicians can do fairly easily. Just get a few clinicians in a room, and ask them for the highest and lowest values of HgbA1c that they have ever seen. You will quickly find a minimum and maximum that you can estimate as the range (in this case, let’s say 5.0 and 17.0 for min and max of Hgb A1c). This range divided by 4 is a reasonable rough estimate of the standard deviation. Remember that a normally distributed continuous value will have a 95% confidence interval that is plus or minus 1.96 standard deviations from the sample mean. Round this up to 2 for the full range, and you can see why we divide the range by 4 to get an estimate of the standard deviation. In our case, the difference is 2 and the range/4 (estimate of SD) is 3. So our effect size (Cohen’s d) is 0.66. Plug in 0.66 for d in the code chunk below, and run this code chunk to get an estimate of the n in each arm of a 2 armed study with a two sample t-test of the primary endpoint. pwr::pwr.t.test(n = NULL, sig.level = 0.05, type = &quot;two.sample&quot;, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, power = 0.80, d = __) We come up with 37.02 participants in each group to provide 80% power to detect a difference of 2 in HgbA1c, assuming a standard deviation of 3, using a two-sided alpha of 0.05. To conduct this study, assuming a 20% dropout rate in each arm, would require 37+8 subjects per arm, or 90 overall. At an enrollment rate of 10 per month, it will require 9 months to enroll all the participants, and 21 months (9 + 12 month intervention) to complete the data collection. It is a very common mistake to look at the result for n, and assume that this is your total sample size needed. The n provided by {pwr} is the number per arm. You need to multiply this n by the number of arms (or in a paired analysis, by the number of pairs) to get your total n. Another common mistake is to assume no dropout of participants. It is important to have a reasonable estimate (10-20% for short studies, 30-50% for long or demanding studies) and inflate your intended sample size by this amount. It is even better if you know from similar studies what the actual dropout rate was, and use this as an estimate (if there are similar previous studies). As a general rule, it is better to be conservative, and estimate a larger sample size, than to end up with p = 0.07. Once you define your test type (the options are “two.sample”, “one.sample”, and “paired”), and the alternative (“two.sided”, “greater”, or “less”), four variables remain in a sample size and power calculation. These are the remaining four arguments of the pwr.t.test() function. These are: n the significance level (sig.level) the power the effect size (Cohen’s d) If you know any three of these, you can calculate the fourth. In order to do this, you set the one of these four arguments that you want to calculate equal to NULL, and specify the other 3. Imagine that we only have enough funds to run this study on 50 participants. What would our power be to detect a difference of 2 in Hgb A1c? You can set the power to NULL, and the n to 25 (remember that n is per arm), and run the chunk below. pwr::pwr.t.test(n = __, # note that n is per arm sig.level = 0.05, type = &quot;two.sample&quot;, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, power = __, d = 0.66) We end up with 62.8% power, assuming no participant dropout (which is an extremely unlikely assumption). You can do the same thing, changing the NULL, to calculate an effect size or a significance level, if you have any need to. In most cases, you are calculating a sample size, then realizing that you might not have that much money/resources. Then many calculate the power you would obtain given the resources you actually have. Let’s show a few more examples. 10.2 One Sample t-test for Lowering Creatinine Eddie Enema, holistic healer, has proposed an unblinded pilot study of thrice-daily 2 liter enemas with “Eddie’s Dialysis Cleanser,” a proprietary mix of vitamins and minerals, which he believes will lower the serum creatinine of patients on the kidney transplant waiting list by more than 1.0 g/dL in 24 hours. The creatinine SD in this group of patients is 2. The null hypothesis is &lt; 1.0 g/dL. The alternative hypothesis is &gt;= 1.0 g/dL. Cohen’s d is 1.0 (the proposed change, or delta)/2 (the SD) = 0.5. How many participants would Eddie Enema have to recruit to have 80% power to test this one-sample, one-sided hypothesis, with an alpha of 0.05? Check each of the argument values and run the chunk below to find out. pwr::pwr.t.test(n = NULL, # note that n is per arm sig.level = 0.05, type = &quot;one.sample&quot;, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;, power = 0.8, d = 0.5) Fast Eddie would need to recruit slightly more than 26 participants (you always have to round up to get whole human participants) to have 80% power, assuming no dropout between the first and third enema, or before the blood draw 24 hours after baseline. Note that since this is an unblinded, one-sample study, The n in the results is multiplied by the number of arms (there is only 1 arm) to give you a sample size of 27. A note about alpha and beta alpha is described as the type I error, or the probability of declaring significant a difference that is not truly significant. We often use a two-sided alpha, which cuts the region of significance in half, and distributes it to both tails of the distribution, allowing for both significant positive and negative differences. Alpha is commonly set at 0.05, which works out to 0.025 on each tail of the distribution with a two-tailed alpha. beta is the power, or (1- the risk of type II error). Type II error is the probability of missing a significant result and declaring it nonsignificant after hypothesis testing. Power is often set at 80%, or 0.8, but can be 90%, 95%, or 99%, depending on how important it is not to miss a significant result, and how much money and time you have to spend (both of which tend to increase N and power). There is often an important tradeoff between type I and type II error. Things that decrease type II error (increase power) like spending more time and money for a larger N, will increase your risk of type I error. Conversely, reducing your risk of type I error will generally increase your risk of type II error. You may be in situations in which you have to decide which type of error is more important to avoid for your clinical situation to maximize benefit and minimize harms for patients. 10.3 Paired t-tests (before vs after, or truly paired) As you can see from the above example, you can use a before-after design to measure differences from baseline, and essentially convert a two-sample paired design (each participant’s baseline measurement is paired with their post-intervention measurement) to a single sample design based on the difference between the before and after values. The before-after (or baseline-postintervention) design is probably the most common paired design, but occasionally we have truly paired designs, like when we test an ointment for psoriasis on one arm, and use a placebo or sham ointment on the other arm. When this is possible, through bilateral symmetry (this also works for eyedrops in eyes, or dental treatments), it is much more efficient (in the recruiting sense) than recruiting separate groups for the treatment and control arms. To see the difference between two-sample and paired designs, run the code chunk below, for a two-sample study with a Cohen’s d of 0.8 and 80% power. Then change the type to “paired”, and see the effect on sample size. pwr::pwr.t.test(n = NULL, # note that n is per arm sig.level = 0.05, type = &quot;two.sample&quot;, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, power = 0.8, d = 0.8) Note that this changes the needed sample size from 52 subjects (26 per arm) to 15 subjects (as there is only one participant needed each paired application of 2 study treatments, and n in this case indicates the number of pairs), though it would be wise to randomize patients to having the treatment on the right vs. left arm (to maintain the blind). This is a large gain in recruiting efficiency. Use paired designs whenever you can. 10.4 2 Sample t tests with Unequal Study Arm Sizes Occasionally investigators want unbalanced arms, as they feel that patients are more likely to participate if they have a greater chance of receiving the study drug than the placebo. It is fairly common to use 2:1 or 3:1 ratios. Larger ratios, like 4:1 or 5:1, are thought to risk increasing the placebo response rate, as participants assume that they are on the active drug. This is somewhat less efficient in recruiting terms, but it may improve the recruiting rate enough to compensate for the loss in efficiency. This requires a slightly different function, the pwr.t2n.test() function. Let’s look at an example below. Instead of n, we have n1 and n2, and we have to specify one of these, and leave the other as NULL. Or we can try a variety of ratios of n1 and n2, leaving the power set to NULL, and test numbers to produce the desired power. We are proposing a study in which the expected reduction in systolic blood pressure is 10 mm Hg, with a standard deviation of 20 mm Hg. We choose an n1 of 40, and a power of 80%, then let the function determine n2. pwr::pwr.t2n.test(n1 = 40, n2 = NULL, sig.level = 0.05, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, power = 0.8, d = 0.5) In this case, n2 works out to slightly over 153 in the drug arm, or nearly 4:1. Calculating effect size, or Cohen’s d. You can calculate the d value yourself. Or, you can make your life easier to let the {pwr} package do this for you. You can leave the calculation of the delta/SD to the program, by setting d = (20-10)/20, and the program will calculate the d of 0.5 for you. We can also round up the ratio to 4:1 (160:40) and determine the resulting power. pwr::pwr.t2n.test(n1 = c(40), n2 = c(160), sig.level = 0.05, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, power = NULL, d = 0.5) This provides a power of 80.3%. 10.5 Testing Multiple Options and Plotting Results It can be helpful to compare multiple scenarios, varying the n or the estimated effect size, to examine trade-offs and potential scenarios when planning a trial. You can test multiple particular scenarios by listing the variables in a concatenated vector, as shown below for n1 and n2. pwr::pwr.t2n.test(n1 = c(40, 60, 80), n2 = c(80, 120, 160), sig.level = 0.05, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, power = NULL, d = 0.5) This provides 3 distinct scenarios, with 3 pairs of n1/n2 values, and the calculated power for each scenario. You can also examine many scenarios, with the sequence function, seq(). For the sequence function, three arguments are needed: from, the number the sequence starts from to, the number the sequence ends at (inclusive) by, the number to increment by Note that the length of the sequences produced by seq() must match (or be a multiple of the other) if you are sequencing multiple arguments, so that there is a number for each scenario. If the lengths of the sequences are multiples of each other (8 and 4 in the example below), the shorter sequence (n2) will be silently “recycled” (used again in the same order) to produce a vector of matching length (8). pwr::pwr.t2n.test(n1 = seq(from = 40, to = 75, by = 5), n2 = seq(60, 120, 20), sig.level = 0.05, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, power = NULL, d = 0.5) Sometimes it is helpful to look at multiple scenarios and plot the results. You can do this by leaving n = NULL, and plotting the results, as seen below. The null value will be varied across a reasonable range, and the results plotted, with an optimal value identified. The plot function will use ggplot2 if this package is loaded, or base R plotting if ggplot2 is not available. As you can see below, you can modify the ggplot2 plot of the results with standard ggplot2 functions. results &lt;- pwr::pwr.t2n.test(n1 = c(40), n2 = NULL, sig.level = 0.05, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, power = 0.80, d = 0.5) plot(results) + ggplot2::theme_minimal(base_size = 14) + labs(title = &#39;Optimizing Sample Size for my 2-Sided t test&#39;, subtitle = &quot;Always Round up for Whole Participants, N = 194&quot;) Note that the results object is a list, and you can access individual pieces with the dollar sign operator, so that `results$n1` equals 40, and `results$n2` equals 153. You can examine the components of the results object in the Environment pane in RStudio. You can use these in inline R expressions in an Rmarkdown document to write up your results. Remember that each inline R expression is wrapped in backwards apostrophes, like `r code` (using the character to the left of the 1 key on the standard US keyboard), and starts with an r to let the computer know that the incoming code is written in R. This helps you write up a sentence like the below for a grant application: Using an estimated effect size of 0.5, with a two-sided alpha of 0.05, we calculated that for 40 participants in group 1, 153.0968718 participants would be needed in group 2 to produce a power of 0.8. When you knit an Rmarkdown file with these inline R expressions, each will be automatically converted to the result number and appear as standard text. 10.6 Your Turn Try calculating the sample size or power needed in the continuous outcome scenarios below. See if you can plot the results as directed by editing the code chunks. 10.6.1 Scenario 1: FEV1 in COPD You want to increase the FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) of patients with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) by 10% of predicted from baseline using weekly inhaled stem cells vs. placebo. Unfortunately, the standard deviation of FEV1 measurements is 20%. You want to have 80% power to detect this difference, with a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, with equal n in each of the two arms. Fill in the blanks in the code chunk below to calculate the sample size needed (n x number of arms). Remember that the effect size (Cohen’s d) = change in endpoint (delta)/SD of the endpoint. pwr::pwr.t.test(n = __, # note that n is per arm sig.level = __, type = &quot;__&quot;, alternative = &quot;__&quot;, power = __, d = __) You should get 128 participants (assuming no dropout) from 64 per arm. Cohen’s d is 10/20 = 0.5. It can be tricky to keep the type of “two.sample” and the alternative of “two.sided” straight. But you can do this! 10.6.2 Scenario 2: BNP in CHF You want to decrease the BNP (brain natriuretic protein) of patients with CHF (congestive heart failure) by 300 pg/mL from baseline with a new oral intropic agent vs. placebo. BNP levels go up during worsening of heart failure, and a variety of effective treatments lower BNP, which can function as surrogate marker in clinical trials. The standard deviation of BNP measurements is estimated at 350 pg/mL. You want to have 80% power to detect this difference, with a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, with equal n in each of the two arms. Also consider an alternative scenario with a change in BNP of only 150 pg/mL. Remember that the effect size (Cohen’s d) = change in endpoint (delta)/SD of the endpoint. Fill in the blanks in the code chunk below (2 scenarios) to calculate the sample size needed (n x number of arms) for both alternatives. pwr::pwr.t.test(n = __, # note that n is per arm sig.level = __, type = &quot;two.__&quot;, alternative = &quot;two.__&quot;, power = __, d = __/__) pwr::pwr.t.test(n = __, # note that n is per arm sig.level = __, type = &quot;two.__&quot;, alternative = &quot;two.__&quot;, power = __, d = __/__) You should get 46 participants (assuming no dropout) from 23 per arm x 2 arms, or 174 participants (87x2) with the alternative effect size. The effect size (Cohen’s d) is 300/350 = 0.86 in the original, and 150/350 (0.43) in the alternative effect. Note that you can let R calculate the Cohen’s d - just type in 300/350 and 150/350, and R will use these as values of d. 10.6.3 Scenario 3: Barthel Index in Stroke You want to increase the Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index of patients with stroke by 25 points from baseline with an intensive in-home PT and OPT intervention vs. usual care (which usually increases BADLI by only 5 points). You roughly estimate the standard deviation of Barthel index measurements as 38. You want to have 80% power to detect this difference, with a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, with equal n in each of the two arms. You want to consider multiple possible options for n, and plot these for a nice figure in your grant application. Fill in the blanks in the code chunk below to calculate and plot the sample size needed (n x number of arms). results &lt;- pwr::pwr.t.test(n = __, # note that n is per arm sig.level = __, type = &quot;two.__&quot;, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, power = __, d = __ ) plot(results) You should get an optimal sample size of 116 participants (assuming no dropout) from 58 per arm x 2 arms, with a nice plot to show this in your grant proposal. The effect size (Cohen’s d) is (25-5)/38 = 0.526. 10.7 Sample Sizes for Proportions Let’s assume that patients discharged from your hospital after a myocardial infarction have historically received a prescription for aspirin 80% of the time. A nursing quality improvement project on the cardiac floor has tried to increase this rate to 95%. How many patients do you need to track after the QI intervention to determine if the proportion has truly increased? the null hypothesis is that the proportion is 0.8 the alternative hypothesis is that the proportion is 0.95. For this, we need the pwr.p.test() function for one proportion. We will also use a built-in function of {pwr}, the ES.h() function, to help us calculate the effect size. This function takes our two hypothesized proportions and calculates an effect size with an arcsine transformation. pwr.p.test(h = ES.h(p1 = 0.95, p2 = 0.80), n = NULL, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.80, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;) ## ## proportion power calculation for binomial distribution (arcsine transformation) ## ## h = 0.4762684 ## n = 27.25616 ## sig.level = 0.05 ## power = 0.8 ## alternative = greater We need to evaluate at least the next 28 patients discharged with MIs to have 80% power to test this one-sided hypothesis. A note about test sided-ness and publication. Frequently in common use, you may only be focused on an increase or decrease in a proportion or a continuous outcome, and a one-sided test seems reasonable. This is fine for internal use or local quality improvement work. However, for FDA approval of a drug, for grant applications, or for journal publications, the standard is to always use two-sided tests, being open to the possibility of both improvement or worsening of the outcome you are studying. This is important to know before you submit a grant application, a manuscript for publication, or a dossier for FDA approval of a drug or device. 10.8 Sample size for two proportions, equal n For this, we need the pwr.2p.test() function for two proportions. You want to calculate the sample size for a study of a cardiac plexus parasympathetic nerve stimulator for pulmonary hypertension. You expect the baseline one year mortality to be 15% in high-risk patients, and expect to reduce this to 5% with this intervention. You will compare a sham (turned off) stimulator to an active stimulator in a 2 arm study. Use a 2-sided alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80%. Copy and edit the code chunk below to determine the sample size (n, rounded up) per arm, and the overall sample size (2n) fo the study. pwr.p.test(h = ES.h(p1 = __, p2 = __), n = __, sig.level = __, power = __, alternative = &quot;__&quot;) We need to enroll at least 67 per arm, or 134 overall. Dichotomous endpoints are generally regarded as having greater clinical significance than continuous endpoints, but often require more power and sample size (and more money and time). Most investigators are short on money and time, and prefer continuous outcome endpoints. 10.9 Sample size for two proportions, unequal arms For this, we need the pwr.2p2n.test() function for two proportions with unequal sample sizes. Imagine you want to enroll class IV CHF patients in a device trial in which they will be randomized 3:1 to a device (vs sham) that restores their serum sodium to 140 mmol/L and their albumin to 40 mg/dL each night. You expect to reduce 1 year mortality from 80% to 65% with this device. You want to know what your power will be if you enroll 300 in the device arm and 100 in the sham arm. pwr.2p2n.test(h = ES.h(p1 = __, p2 = __), n1 = __, n2 = __, sig.level = __, power = __, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;) This (300:100) enrollment will have 84.6% power to detect a change from 15% to 5% mortality, with a two-sided alpha of 0.05. 10.10 Your Turn Try calculating the sample size or power needed in the proportional outcome scenarios below. See if you can plot the results as directed by editing the code chunks. 10.10.1 Scenario 1: Mortality on Renal Dialysis You want to decrease the mortality of patients on renal dialysis, which averages 20% per year in your local dialysis center. You will randomize patients to a bundle of statin, aspirin, beta blocker, and weekly erythropoietin vs. usual care, and hope to reduce annual mortality to 10%. You want to have 80% power to detect this difference, with a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, with equal n in each of the two arms. Fill in the blanks in the code chunk below to calculate the sample size needed (n x number of arms). pwr.p.test(h = ES.h(p1 = __, p2 = __), n = __, sig.level = .05, power = __, alternative = &quot;two.__&quot;) You always round up first (to whole participants per arm), then multiply by the number of arms. You will need a minimum of 98 per arm, for a total of 196 participants needed to complete the trial. 10.10.2 Scenario 2: Intestinal anastomosis in Crohn’s disease You want to decrease 1-year endoscopic recurrence rate in Crohn’s disease from 90% to 70%. A local surgeon claims that his new “slipknot anastomosis” technique will accomplish this, by reducing colonic backwash and thereby, reducing endoscopic recurrence. You want to have 80% power to detect this difference, with a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, with equal n in each of the two arms. Also consider an alternative, more conservative scenario with a endoscopic recurrence rate of 80% with the new method. Fill in the blanks in the code chunk below to calculate the sample size needed (n x number of arms) for both alternatives. pwr.p.test(h = c(ES.h(p1 = 0.9, p2 = __)), n = NULL, sig.level = .05, power = __, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;) pwr.p.test(h = c(ES.h(p1 = __, p2 = __)), n = __, sig.level = __, power = .80, alternative = __) With the originally claimed recurrence proportion of 70%, you will need 30 participants per arm, or 60 for the whole study. The more conservative estimate will require 98 subjects per arm, or 196 for the whole study. 10.10.3 Scenario 3: Metformin in Donuts Your local endocrinologist has identified consumption of glazed donuts as a major risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes in your region. She proposes to randomize participants to glazed donuts spiked with metformin vs usual donuts, expecting to reduce the 1 year proportion of prediabetics with a HgbA1c &gt; 7.0 from 25% to 10%. You want to have 80% power to detect this difference, with a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, with 2 times as many participants in the metformin donut arm. You want to consider multiple possible sample sizes (n = 25, 50, 75) for the control glazed donuts, with 2n (double the sample size in each scenario) for the metformin donuts group. Fill in the blanks in the code chunk below to calculate the resulting power for each of the three sample size scenarios. pwr.2p2n.test(h = ES.h(p1 = __, p2 = __), n1 = seq(from = __, to = __, by = 25), n2 = seq(from = __, to = __, by = 50), sig.level = __, power = NULL, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;) You should get a power of 37.7% for the smallest n, 64.5% for n1=50/n2=100, and 81.4% for the largest n scenario. 10.11 add chi square 10.12 add correlation test 10.13 add anova 10.14 add linear model 10.15 add note on guessing effect sizes - cohen small, medium, large 10.16 Explore More You can explore other examples here in the official {pwr} vignette.

You can find many of these on the CRAN Task View for Clinical Trials, at https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ClinicalTrials.html. This is a curated list of packages that anyone might find useful in designing, monitoring, or analyzing clinical trials, and is often a good place to start in looking for packages that might be relevant for clinical trials. If you use Ctrl-F to search the web page for “rand”, several packages address randomization, including blockrand randomizeR pwr experiment clusterPower CRTSize cosa PowerupR Several of these are specifically for more complex designs, including cluster and multilevel randomization (clusterPower, cosa, CRTSize). For today, we will focus on the straightforward randomization packages including {blockrand} and {randomizer}. The {blockrand} package creates randomizations for clinical trials with can include stratified enrollment and permuted block randomization, and can produce a PDF file of randomization cards. Let’s start with an example in {blockrand}. Details on the package can be found at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blockrand/blockrand.pdf or by running help(blockrand) in your Console. You want to randomize 180 inpatients with severe ulcerative colitis to one of 3 arms: corticosteroids alone (control), corticosteroids + tofacitinib, or corticosteroids + upadacitinib. You want to stratify the participants by (1) prior biologic failure and (2) Albumin level above or below 3.0. To be prepared for dropouts and imbalanced enrollment, you want to have a randomization list with at least 60 assignments available for each arm and stratum. To avoid a recognizable pattern in the randomization, you want to have a permuted block design with blocks of sizes 3, 6, and 9. Below, you will see how to do this for the biologic failure - low albumin stratum. bfla &lt;- blockrand(n = 60, num.levels = 3, # three treatments levels = c(&quot;CS&quot;, &quot;CS/Tofa&quot;, &quot;CS/Upa&quot;), # arm names stratum = &quot;Bfail.LowAlb&quot;, # stratum name id.prefix = &quot;BfLA&quot;, # stratum abbrev block.sizes = c(1,2,3), # times arms = 3,6,9 block.prefix = &quot;BfLA&quot;) # stratum abbrev bfla ## id stratum block.id block.size treatment ## 1 BfLA01 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA01 9 CS/Tofa ## 2 BfLA02 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA01 9 CS/Upa ## 3 BfLA03 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA01 9 CS ## 4 BfLA04 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA01 9 CS ## 5 BfLA05 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA01 9 CS ## 6 BfLA06 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA01 9 CS/Upa ## 7 BfLA07 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA01 9 CS/Upa ## 8 BfLA08 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA01 9 CS/Tofa ## 9 BfLA09 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA01 9 CS/Tofa ## 10 BfLA10 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA02 3 CS/Tofa ## 11 BfLA11 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA02 3 CS ## 12 BfLA12 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA02 3 CS/Upa ## 13 BfLA13 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA03 6 CS/Upa ## 14 BfLA14 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA03 6 CS ## 15 BfLA15 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA03 6 CS/Upa ## 16 BfLA16 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA03 6 CS ## 17 BfLA17 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA03 6 CS/Tofa ## 18 BfLA18 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA03 6 CS/Tofa ## 19 BfLA19 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA04 6 CS ## 20 BfLA20 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA04 6 CS/Tofa ## 21 BfLA21 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA04 6 CS ## 22 BfLA22 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA04 6 CS/Upa ## 23 BfLA23 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA04 6 CS/Upa ## 24 BfLA24 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA04 6 CS/Tofa ## 25 BfLA25 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA05 6 CS/Upa ## 26 BfLA26 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA05 6 CS/Tofa ## 27 BfLA27 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA05 6 CS ## 28 BfLA28 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA05 6 CS ## 29 BfLA29 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA05 6 CS/Upa ## 30 BfLA30 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA05 6 CS/Tofa ## 31 BfLA31 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA06 3 CS/Upa ## 32 BfLA32 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA06 3 CS ## 33 BfLA33 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA06 3 CS/Tofa ## 34 BfLA34 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA07 6 CS ## 35 BfLA35 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA07 6 CS ## 36 BfLA36 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA07 6 CS/Upa ## 37 BfLA37 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA07 6 CS/Tofa ## 38 BfLA38 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA07 6 CS/Tofa ## 39 BfLA39 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA07 6 CS/Upa ## 40 BfLA40 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA08 3 CS/Tofa ## 41 BfLA41 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA08 3 CS/Upa ## 42 BfLA42 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA08 3 CS ## 43 BfLA43 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA09 3 CS/Tofa ## 44 BfLA44 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA09 3 CS ## 45 BfLA45 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA09 3 CS/Upa ## 46 BfLA46 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA10 9 CS/Tofa ## 47 BfLA47 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA10 9 CS/Upa ## 48 BfLA48 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA10 9 CS ## 49 BfLA49 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA10 9 CS/Upa ## 50 BfLA50 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA10 9 CS/Tofa ## 51 BfLA51 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA10 9 CS ## 52 BfLA52 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA10 9 CS ## 53 BfLA53 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA10 9 CS/Tofa ## 54 BfLA54 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA10 9 CS/Upa ## 55 BfLA55 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA11 9 CS ## 56 BfLA56 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA11 9 CS/Upa ## 57 BfLA57 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA11 9 CS/Tofa ## 58 BfLA58 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA11 9 CS/Upa ## 59 BfLA59 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA11 9 CS/Upa ## 60 BfLA60 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA11 9 CS/Tofa ## 61 BfLA61 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA11 9 CS ## 62 BfLA62 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA11 9 CS/Tofa ## 63 BfLA63 Bfail.LowAlb BfLA11 9 CS You can see the id for each participant, their stratum, the block.id for their permuted block, the block.size, and their assigned treatment.

You can do this with the plotblockrand() function. This function creates a pdf file of randomization cards for printing. These are designed so that the middle text will show in a standard letter sized envelope with a window, and the top text (the assignment) can be folded over to increase security (against anyone trying to peek through the security envelope to guess the assignment). uc_study &lt;- bind_rows(bfha, bfla, bnha, bnla) # bind together the four strata into one dataframe blockrand::plotblockrand(uc_study, # input dataframe file = &quot;uc_study.pdf&quot;, # output pdf # top hidden text with assignment top=list(text=c(&#39;My Study&#39;,&#39;Patient: %ID%&#39;,&#39;Treatment: %TREAT%&#39;), col=c(&#39;black&#39;,&#39;black&#39;,&#39;red&#39;),font=c(1,1,4)), # middle text to show through window of # 10 envelope middle=list(text=c(&quot;My Study&quot;,&quot;Stratum: %STRAT%&quot;,&quot;Patient: %ID%&quot;), col=c(&#39;black&#39;,&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;orange&#39;),font=c(1,2,3)), # bottom text- any instructions to study coordinator bottom=&quot;Call 123-4567 to report patient entry&quot;, cut.marks=TRUE) # add cut marks - 4 per page Open up the file uc_study.pdf in your Files tab to see the output pdf file, with assorted fonts and colors. Just for fun, change (and then re-run) the text “My Study” to something more interesting change “Patient” to “Participant” change “Treatment” to “Arm” or “Assignment” change some of the colors to standard R colors change some of the fonts (within 1-4) Sometimes with equal blocks, and clear treatment effects or side effects, nurses or study coordinators can guess the randomization pattern. If you want to get fancy, and make it even harder to guess treatment assignments, you can add one of the unequal blocks options, to make it hard to find patterns in treatment or in side effects. Set uneq.beg = TRUE for an unequal block in the beginning, or uneq.mid = TRUE for an unequal block in the middle. 11.2 Now, try this yourself You want to randomize 80 outpatients with Crohn’s disease to one of 8 arms, as part of a 2^3 factorial design to increase patient activation. These arms involve using (A,B, C) or not using (a,b,c) 3 intervention components. The 8 arms then become: abc abC aBc aBC Abc AbC ABc ABC Then we want to stratify the participants by baseline PAM score (a measure of patient activation) with levels of low, medium, and high PAM. To be prepared for dropouts and imbalanced enrollment, you want to have a randomization list with at least 32 assignments available for each arm and stratum. To avoid a recognizable pattern in the randomization, you want to have a permuted block design with blocks of sizes 8 and 16. You can hover over top right corner of the code chunk below, and a copy icon will appear - click this to copy the code to your clipboard. You can then paste it into your local version of RStudio, edit it, and run it. In the code block below, fill in the blanks to complete the code to make a dataframe for the low_pam stratum. low_pam &lt;- blockrand(n = __, num.levels = __, #eight treatments levels = c(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;abC&quot;, &quot;aBc&quot;, &quot;aBC&quot;, &quot;Abc&quot;, &quot;AbC&quot;, &quot;ABc&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;), # arm names stratum = &quot;__&quot;, # stratum name id.prefix = &quot;lp&quot;, # stratum abbrev block.sizes = c(1,2,3), # times arms block.prefix = &quot;LP&quot;) # stratum abbrev low_pam Now that you have one stratum sorted, edit the code block below to create the med_pam and high_pam strata. med_pam &lt;- blockrand(n = __, num.levels = __, #eight treatments levels = c(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;abC&quot;, &quot;aBc&quot;, &quot;aBC&quot;, &quot;Abc&quot;, &quot;AbC&quot;, &quot;ABc&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;), # arm names stratum = &quot;__&quot;, # stratum name id.prefix = &quot;__&quot;, # stratum abbrev block.sizes = c(__), # times arms block.prefix = &quot;__&quot;) # stratum abbrev med_pam high_pam &lt;- blockrand(n = __, num.levels = __, #eight treatments levels = c(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;abC&quot;, &quot;aBc&quot;, &quot;aBC&quot;, &quot;Abc&quot;, &quot;AbC&quot;, &quot;ABc&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;), # arm names stratum = &quot;__&quot;, # stratum name id.prefix = &quot;__&quot;, # stratum abbrev block.sizes = c(__), # times arms block.prefix = &quot;__&quot;) # stratum abbrev high_pam Great! Now try to bind these 3 strata into one dataframe print these as cards to a pdf file Edit the code chunk below to produce the pdf file cd_study &lt;- bind_rows(__,__,__) # bind together the 3 strata into one dataframe blockrand::plotblockrand(__, # input dataframe file = &quot;cd_study.pdf&quot;, # output pdf # top hidden text with assignment top=list(text=c(&#39;CD Study&#39;,&#39;Patient: %ID%&#39;,&#39;Treatment: %__%&#39;), col=c(&#39;orange&#39;,&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;red&#39;),font=c(1,1,4)), # middle text to show through window of # 10 envelope middle=list(text=c(&quot;CD Study&quot;,&quot;Stratum: %STRAT%&quot;,&quot;Patient: %__%&quot;), col=c(&#39;black&#39;,&#39;red&#39;,&#39;cadetblue&#39;),font=c(1,2,3)), # bottom text- any instructions to study coordinator bottom=&quot;Call 123-4567 to report patient entry&quot;, cut.marks=TRUE) # add cut marks - 4 per page 11.3 Now Freestyle Your turn. Create randomization tables and a pdf file of cards for a study of 2 microbiome interventions to reduce the formation of colon adenomas. your 3 study arms will be - placebo, Streptococcus thermophilus, and S.thermo plus lactose (a preferred sugar for S.t, making this arm a synbiotic, while arm 2 is a probiotic) - aka 3 arms called: pbo, probiotic, synbiotic.

But the number of options, particularly for theming, can get overwhelming. This is especially true if you are not using {ggplot} every day. Medical day (and night) jobs can get in the way of great data visualizations. But there are several helper packages to make your life easier, including {ggx}, {ggThemeAssist}, and {esquisse}. 12.1 ggx::gghelp() Let’s start with {ggx}. The gghelp() function in this simple package converts natural language queries (in quotes) into a ggplot command string. It can be helpful for styling axes, labels, font size, title, and legends. It is limited by its library of commands and range of styling, but can be helpful in a pinch. Try a few questions below, and make your own. ggx::gghelp(&quot;how do I remove the legend&quot;) ## Registered S3 method overwritten by &#39;sets&#39;: ## method from ## print.element ggplot2 ## theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) ggx::gghelp(&quot;how do I increase the font size of the title&quot;) ## theme(axis.title.x=element_text(size=rel(2))) ggx::gghelp(&quot;change the x axis label to &#39;systolic blood pressure&#39;&quot;) ## xlab(&#39;systolic blood pressure&#39;) 12.2 Getting more help with theming with ggThemeAssist ggThemeAssist is an RStudio add-in that you install when you install the {ggThemeAssist} package. It is used after you have your basic plot in place, with the right geom, and the x and y variables in place. Let’s start you out with a simple plot from the {medicaldata} package. This plots the fentanyl requirements for anesthesia in the supraclavicular dataset comparing high and low BMI, age, and gender effects. Run this code block to see what the basic plot looks like. plot1 &lt;- medicaldata::supraclavicular %&gt;% filter(!is.na(bmi)) %&gt;% mutate(gender_cat = case_when(gender == 1 ~ &quot;Male&quot;, gender == 0 ~ &quot;Female&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(bmi_cat = case_when(bmi &lt;30 ~ &quot;low&quot;, bmi &gt;= 30 ~ &quot;high&quot;)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=age, y = fentanyl, col = gender_cat)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(. ~ bmi_cat) plot1 + theme(axis.text.y = element_text(family = &quot;serif&quot;), panel.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;antiquewhite&quot;), plot.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;white&quot;)) + labs(title = &quot;Fentanyl Requirements&quot;, x = &quot;Age&quot;, y = &quot;Fentanyl in mcg&quot;, colour = &quot;Gender&quot;, subtitle = &quot;by BMI and Age&quot;) ## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values ## (geom_point). Now select the code that generates the plot. You can also assign the plot (with an assignment arrow) to an imaginative name, like plot1. You can then select this object as well. Once you have the plot selected in your code, you can activate ggThemeAssist in one of two ways: Go to your Addins dropdown menu, and select ggThemeAssist type in the Console: ggthemeAssistGaget(plot1) Either approach will open up an interactive window, with 6 tabs and a bunch of options. These tabs include: Settings Panel and Background Axis Title and Label Legend Subtitle and Caption Open these up and experiment. You will see the results as you change options. When you are happy with the result, click on the Done button in the top right. This will add all of your thematic changes as valid R code to the existing plot object. 12.3 Website helpers for ggplot Several websites provide quick help for ggplot needs, and are worth bookmarking. The Aesthetics Helper, at https://ggplot2tor.com/aesthetics/, provides a quick guide to which aesthetics are required (green), and which other aesthetics are available (optional, in orange) to map variables in your dataset to components of a plot for each geom. The Guide to Scales, at https://ggplot2tor.com/scales, helps you find the proper names of scales in ggplot2, by selecting your variable type and (if needed) the aesthetic for the scale. Then by clicking on one of the available scales, you can get example code with appropriate syntax for multiple arguments. This can be very helpful in preventing frustration with not having the scales quite right. The R Graph Gallery, at https://www.r-graph-gallery.com, is a popular overview of available graph types. You can quickly scan a bunch of plots based on distributions, correlations, rankings, parts of a whole, change over time, maps, and flow and select one that looks interesting. When you find one you like, you can click on it and get the underlying ggplot code. Another popular web gallery with code is the Top 50 ggplot2 visualizations, at http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html Cedric Scherer has a lengthy free tutorial with lots of great examples at https://www.cedricscherer.com/2019/08/05/a-ggplot2-tutorial-for-beautiful-plotting-in-r/ There is also a gallery of all the many extension packages people have built as add-ons to ggplot, often for specific and specialized plotting needs. Take a loot at https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/ Packages ggridges, ggalluvial, ggmosaic, ggdist, gghalves, and ComplexUpset have proven quite popular. Take a look at all the options for extending ggplot. 12.4 Getting Even more help with esquisse {esquisse} is an RStudio add-in that you install when you install the {esquisse} package. It is used to create plots from scratch in ggplot. A nice website on how to get started can be found at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/esquisse/vignettes/get-started.html But the two ways to get started are to either: run esquisser(dataframe) in the Console, with the dataframe that you want to make a plot from, or In the Addins menu, select ggplot2_builder under ESQUISSE Either approach opens up a new window. If you did not specify a dataframe, it will ask you to select one, either from the Global Environment, or from a data package. For our purposes, select the {medicaldata} package, and the dataframe blood_storage. This will give you a window with many options, and a sandbox full of variables. To look at the data, click on the Show Data icon at top left You can drag variables into different aesthetic mappings. Start with PreopPSA for x TimeToRecurrence for y Age mapped to color FamHx or AA mapped to Size You can drag variables out of mappings and back to the variable sandbox if needed You can click on the Settings Gear at the top right to activate more aesthetics You can click on the geom icon at top left to change the plot type You can edit the Title and Labels with this tab You can edit Plot Options You can edit the plot appearance When you are happy with it, you can click on the Code tab, and copy it to your script. {esquisse} can get you started on good plots, and remind you of ggplot options you may have forgotten (or never knew) about. There are a number of fancy plots and extensions it can not do, and it will not clean your data for you, or reorder factors. But it can be really helpful if you are not plotting very often or if you are just getting started with ggplot. 12.4.1 Acknowledgement This chapter is inspired by a lesson from Claus Wilke at https://wilkelab.org/SDS375/slides/functional-programming "],["functions.html", "Chapter 13 Functions 13.1 Don’t repeat yourself 13.2 Your Turn 13.3 Freestyle 13.4 Read More", " Chapter 13 Functions Nearly everything in R and the tidyverse is built on functions. Every command you write that ends with parentheses is a function. The parentheses contain arguments (unless you just use the defaults), which the function acts upon. If you type a function into the console and forget the parentheses, you may be surprised at what you get back when you press the Enter key. Try this with the sd function by running the chunk below sd At first this looks like computer gobbledygook, but if you look at it closely, the first line sets up the structure of the function and its arguments, and the second line defines the function as the square root of the variance of a vector that contains numbers. You are seeing the inner workings of the sd function. Other functions may be written in other languages (like C++) for more speed, but you can use R to write more R functions. When you try this for another function, like filter in the dplyr package, it is less informative. As you can see when you unpack the function below. dplyr::filter 13.1 Don’t repeat yourself Functions are especially helpful when you do something repeatedly, or do the same thing on several variables or several datasets. Let’s start with a simple plot of Ct (COVID viral load) vs age for inpatients. Run the code chunk below. covid %&gt;% filter(patient_class == &quot;inpatient&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = age, y = ct_result) + geom_point() + theme_linedraw() + labs(y = &quot;viral load (in Ct)&quot;, title = &quot;Patient class: inpatient&quot;) This is great, but you would like a similar plot for ER patients, observation patients, outpatients, etc. How do you do this without multiple copy-paste and careful edits of the key variables (often with errors)? First, you need to avoid hard-coding the specific values that change from plot to plot. In our next version of this plot, we will set an envronment variable (patient_class_choice_env) to “inpatient”, then use that variable to: filter the data set the title (using the glue function) patient_class_choice_env = &quot;inpatient&quot; covid %&gt;% filter(.data$patient_class == .env$patient_class_choice_env) %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = age, y = ct_result) + geom_point() + theme_linedraw() + labs(y = &quot;viral load (in Ct)&quot;, title = glue(&quot;Patient class: {patient_class_choice_env}&quot;)) The use of variable pronouns is very important in the filter step. .data$patient_class means the variable “patient_class” in the currently in-use dataframe. .env$patient_class_choice_env means the variable “patient_class_choice_env” in the current environment (check the Environment pane). This can be especially helpful when these variables have the same names - the .data pronoun helps you refer specifically to variables in the dataframe, and the .env pronoun helps you refer specifically to variables in the environment. It is usually better to give these slightly different names. In this case, I have added the suffix, “choice_env” for the variable in the environment in which I have specified the value chosen. Let’s try another example. In the code chunk below, edit the patient_class_choice_env variable to the value “emergency”, and then run the code chunk. patient_class_choice_env = &quot;emergency&quot; covid %&gt;% filter(.data$patient_class == .env$patient_class_choice_env) %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = age, y = ct_result) + geom_point() + theme_linedraw() + labs(y = &quot;viral load (in Ct)&quot;, title = glue(&quot;Patient class: {patient_class_choice_env}&quot;)) Fairly slick, right? You can edit and run through each value for patient_class. But what if you want to automate this, and just produce all the plots for all the possible values? To do this, you have to turn your plot into a function. To make a function, you first need a chunk of code with no hard-coded values. Then, you wrap the code in curly braces, and preface it with “function(arguments)” Then you assign it to a function name. Examine, then run the example below. make_covid_plot &lt;- function(patient_class_choice_env) { covid %&gt;% filter(.data$patient_class == .env$patient_class_choice_env) %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = age, y = ct_result) + geom_point() + theme_linedraw() + labs(y = &quot;viral load (in Ct)&quot;, title = glue(&quot;Patient class: {patient_class_choice_env}&quot;)) } make_covid_plot(&quot;recurring outpatient&quot;) Note that this creates a function object named make_covid_plot in your Environment pane. And you still have to call the function with the argument “recurring outpatient” to get one plot. Generally, you should write functions when you find yourself copy-pasting the same code several times. Each function should be no more than 20-30 lines. If longer, break it up into a couple of functions. You can do this repeatedly, over several values for patient_class. Try this below by editing the code chunk to make plots for “emergency” and “not applicable” patient classes. make_covid_plot(&quot;outpatient&quot;) make_covid_plot(&quot;observation&quot;) This is better, but it is still not completely automated. Let’s automate calling the function over several values with the map function. map takes each element of the vector patient_class and uses it as input for make_covid_plot(). map returns a list of created plots. We can return these with bracket references to items 1,2, and 3 in the list. patient_class &lt;- c(&quot;emergency&quot;, &quot;inpatient&quot;, &quot;observation&quot;) plots &lt;- map(patient_class, make_covid_plot) plots[[1]] plots[[2]] plots[[3]] We can make this simpler with the walk function. The walk function is like map, but it does not return values, only side effects (like printing). In this case, it is applying the print function to each element of the plots list. walk(plots, print) We can automate this further, and not need to supply the vector of patient_class values. We can automate it by applying the make_covid_plot function to all available patient_class values. To demonstrate this, we need a more general function, with 2 arguments: one for the dataset, and one for for patient_class. We will test this on the “inpatient” class. The filtering operation will be moved outside of the function make_covid_plot_2 &lt;- function(data, patient_class) { data %&gt;% # note data argument # filtering now done outside of function ggplot() + aes(x = age, y = ct_result) + geom_point() + theme_linedraw() + labs(y = &quot;viral load (in Ct)&quot;, title = glue(&quot;Patient class: {patient_class}&quot;)) } data_inpatient &lt;- covid %&gt;% filter(patient_class == &quot;inpatient&quot;) make_covid_plot_2(data_inpatient, patient_class = &quot;inpatient&quot;) Now we can try this in a tidy pipeline. We will first subset the data by nesting it with the nest function. Take a look at what this does covid %&gt;% nest(data = -patient_class) ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## patient_class data ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;list&gt; ## 1 observation &lt;tibble [28 × 16]&gt; ## 2 outpatient &lt;tibble [65 × 16]&gt; ## 3 emergency &lt;tibble [124 × 16]&gt; ## 4 recurring outpatient &lt;tibble [11 × 16]&gt; ## 5 inpatient &lt;tibble [111 × 16]&gt; We have essentially grouped the data in to 5 distinct tibbles (dataframes) in the list-column named data. These are dataframes in a column nested inside of a larger dataframe. Now we can make a plot from each of these smaller dataframes, using the mutate function and the map function, and our original make_covid_plot function. covid %&gt;% nest(data = -patient_class) %&gt;% mutate(plots = map(patient_class, make_covid_plot)) ## # A tibble: 5 x 3 ## patient_class data plots ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;list&gt; &lt;list&gt; ## 1 observation &lt;tibble [28 × 16]&gt; &lt;gg&gt; ## 2 outpatient &lt;tibble [65 × 16]&gt; &lt;gg&gt; ## 3 emergency &lt;tibble [124 × 16]&gt; &lt;gg&gt; ## 4 recurring outpatient &lt;tibble [11 × 16]&gt; &lt;gg&gt; ## 5 inpatient &lt;tibble [111 × 16]&gt; &lt;gg&gt; Now we have a column that contains the plots. We can pull these out of the dataframe into a vector with the pull function (because walk works on vectors), then print them to the Plots tab with the walk function. covid %&gt;% nest(data = -patient_class) %&gt;% mutate(plots = map(patient_class, make_covid_plot)) %&gt;% pull(plots) %&gt;% walk(print) Note that we could also walk the ggsave function if we wanted to save these plots as tiffs or pdfs or png files. We can use our more generalizable function make_covid_plot_2 in this pipeline if we use map2, which is like map, but for functions with 2 arguments. The arguments of the map2 function include the two arguments (data, patient_class) for making plots, and then the function (make_covid_plot_2). covid %&gt;% nest(data = -patient_class) %&gt;% mutate(plots = map2(data, patient_class, make_covid_plot_2)) %&gt;% pull(plots) %&gt;% walk(print) This version of the pipeline will automatically process all patient classes in the dataset, whatever they are called, without us having to specify them. 13.2 Your Turn Let’s look at how to do this with the prostate dataset. We will start with a simple violin and jitter plot of time to recurrence by baseline Gleason score (bgs), in the subgroup where rbc_age_group = 1. rbc_age_group = 1 prostate %&gt;% filter(rbc_age_group == 1) %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = bgs, y = time_to_recurrence, fill = bgs) + geom_violin() + geom_jitter(width = 0.2) + theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Baseline Gleason Score&quot;, y = &#39;Time to Recurrence&#39;, title = glue(&quot;Preop PSA by baseline Gleason Score for RBC Age: {rbc_age_group}&quot;)) We would like to make this plot for each level of rbc age (rbc_age_group). Let’s walk through the process of how to build this into a function, and how to map it across all the values of rbc_age_group. First, let’s avoid hard-coding the value for rbc_age_group. Use .data$var for a variable in a column, and .env$var for an environment variable. Edit both sides of logic test in the filter statement in the code chunk below to eliminate hard coding the filter variable and the filter value. Then, check that this works for other values by changing the rbc_age_group environmental variable value to 2 or 3. rbc_age_group = 1 prostate %&gt;% filter(rbc_age_group == 1) %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = bgs, y = time_to_recurrence, fill = bgs) + geom_violin() + geom_jitter(width = 0.2) + theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Baseline Gleason Score&quot;, y = &#39;Preoperative PSA&#39;, title = glue(&quot;Preop PSA by baseline Gleason Score for RBC Age: {rbc_age_group}&quot;)) Now make this into a function, named make_plot. Edit the chunk below to turn it into a function by wrapping the code in curly braces on the preceding and following line prefacing the first curly brace with function(argument) - in this case, the argument will be rbc_age_group. assigning the function to the name make_plot Then run make_plot(1) rbc_age_group = 1 { prostate %&gt;% filter(.data$rbc_age_group == .env$rbc_age_group) %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = bgs, y = time_to_recurrence, fill = bgs) + geom_violin() + geom_jitter(width = 0.2) + theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Baseline Gleason Score&quot;, y = &#39;Preoperative PSA&#39;, title = glue(&quot;Preop PSA by baseline Gleason Score for RBC Age: {rbc_age_group}&quot;)) } Now, let’s automate calling the function, with a vector of the values of rbc_age_group, and running the function over each of these with map(vector, function). Edit the vector and function in the code chunk below to use the map function to create a list of plots. Hint - the vector is provided, and your new function name is make_plot. When it is working, simplify the plots1-3 by replacing them with walk(plots, print) rbc_age_group = 1:3 plots &lt;- map(vector, func) plots[[1]] plots[[2]] plots[[3]] Now let’s make this a more generalized function with 2 arguments - data, and rbc_age_group. Edit the code chunk below to create a new function, make_plot2. Remember to: wrap the code in curly braces on the preceding and following line preface the first curly brace with function(arguments) - in this case, the arguments will be data, rbc_age_group. assigning the function to the name make_plot2 Remove the filter step Replace the filter step with a separate (outside the function) filter step to filter for rbc_age_group ==1, that saves the result to data_prostate_1 Then run make_plot2 rbc_age_group = 1 make_plot2 &lt;- function(arg1, arg2){ prostate %&gt;% filter(.data$rbc_age_group == .env$rbc_age_group) %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = bgs, y = time_to_recurrence, fill = bgs) + geom_violin() + geom_jitter(width = 0.2) + theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Baseline Gleason Score&quot;, y = &#39;Preoperative PSA&#39;, title = glue(&quot;Preop PSA by baseline Gleason Score for RBC Age: {rbc_age_group}&quot;)) } data_prostate_1 &lt;- prostate %&gt;% filter(rbc_age_group == 1) make_plot2(data_prostate_1, rbc_age_group = 1) Now let’s try to use make_plot in a tidy pipeline in the chunk below. In the chunk below, you want to nest the data by rbc_age_group, and map the make_plot function over the values of rbc_age_group. Edit both of the var values in the code chunk below to rbc_age_group. Run it to see the nested tibbles and nested plots in your new dataframe. prostate %&gt;% nest(data = -var) %&gt;% mutate(plots = map(var, make_plot)) Now pull out the plots and print them with pull and walk by editing the code chunk below. Pipe this code into the pull and walk functions by adding two lines of code. Remember that the argument for pull is the plotscolumn. Remember that the argument for walk is the print function. prostate %&gt;% nest(data = -rbc_age_group) %&gt;% mutate(plots = map(rbc_age_group, make_plot)) Now let’s make this even more generalizable with the make_plot2 functiion, which has 2 arguments, for data and rbc_age_group. Edit the code chunk below to replace arg1 with the data column, and func with make_plot2. See if this runs prostate %&gt;% nest(data = -rbc_age_group) %&gt;% mutate(plots = map2(arg1, rbc_age_group, func)) %&gt;% pull(plots) %&gt;% walk(print) This version of the pipeline should run for all values of rbc_age_group. 13.3 Freestyle Now try this on your own - and use the outline mode to jump back and forth to previous code chunks to make this easier. Make a plot of age (on the y axis) vs by parity (x axis) in the infert dataset with violin and jitter plots, as in the prostate example prostate-plot-1. This should be filtered for education == “0-5yrs”. Edit to make appropriate axis labels as appropriate. Make a non-hard-coded version, by editing the filter statement with .data and .env variables, and edit the title with glue as in prostate-plot-2. Make this into a function, make_infert_plots, as in prostate-plot-3. Try this with different values for education. Set the levels of education with a vector as in prostate-plot 4, make plots with the map function, and print these out, with the walk function Now make a more generalizable function, make_infert_plots2, by adding a data argument, as in prostate-plot-5. Now nest the data by education, and mutate up some plots with make_infert_plots, as in prostate-plot-6 Then pull these plots and print them out with walk, as in prostate-plot-7 Now make a nested and generalizable version for all values of education, using your make_infert_plots2 function, as in prostate-plot-8 13.4 Read More More on these topics can be found in R for Data Science - Chapter 19: Functions R for Data Science - Chapter 21.5: Map Functions Purrr::map documentation A blog post on how to use purrr:map to make plots for all 50 states and put them into a powerpoint presentation.

The command line is a simple Terminal window with a prompt at which you can type commands, And do primitive but powerful things to your files. The UNIX computing environment was developed in the 1960s, and is still beloved and fetishized by brogrammers, who believe you are not truly a programmmer if you can’t code from the command line. This is silly. The major attraction to UNIX in the 1960s is that it was much better than punch cards. Which isn’t saying much. We have had 60 years of software advancement and user interface improvements, so we really should not have to put up with the inherent user hostility of the UNIX environment. UNIX is an early operating system, which is built around a ‘kernel’ which executes operating system commands, and a ‘shell’ which interprets your commands and sends them to the kernel for execution. The most common shell these days is named ‘bash’, which is a silly recursive brogrammer joke. You will sometimes see references to shell scripts or shell or bash programming. These are the same thing as command line programming. UNIX is a common under-the-hood language across many computers today, as the Apple iOS is built on top of UNIX, and the various versions of the LinuxOS are built on a UNIX-like kernel, with a similar command shell. The command line is often the least common denominator between different pieces of open-source software that were not designed to work together. It can occasionally be helpful to build a data pipeline from mismatched parts. However, there is a lot of low-quality user-hostile command line work involved to get it done, often referred to as “command-line bullshittery”. This is a common bottleneck that slows scientific productivity, and there is a vigorous discussion of it on the interwebs here and here (counterpoint). Essentially, some argue that it is largely a waste of time and effort, while others see it as a valuable learning experience, like doing least squares regression by hand with a pencil. Running R from the command line is a bit like spending a day tuning your car’s engine by yourself. There is a case to be made that this will improve the efficiency and performance of your car, but it is also usually more efficient to pay someone else to do it, unless you are a car expert with a lot of free time. 14.2 Why run R from the command line? You can run R from the command line. It has none of the bells and whistles, nor any of the user conveniences of the RStudio Interactive Developer Environment (IDE). But it is how R was originally expected to be used when it was developed back in 2000 in New Zealand. Running R from the command line allows you to do powerful things, like process multiple files at once, which can be handy when you have multiple files of sequencing data from distinct observations, or you have a multistep data wrangling pipeline with several slow steps. For many years, this was the only way to easily apply code across multiple files to build a complex data pipeline. This is much less true today, with tools to handle file paths like the {here} and {fs} packages, run Python scripts from R with the {reticulate} package, run C++ scripts with Rcpp, and run bash, python, SQL, D3, and Stan scripts from Rmarkdown. You can use the {drake} package to manage multi-step data pipelines in different languages (similar to make). But some labs have been doing things at the command line for years, and find it hard to change. 14.3 How do you get started? First, you need to open a terminal window. And to do that, you need to find it. This is akin to getting under the hood of a car, and computer makers don’t exactly encourage it. 14.3.1 On a Mac Go to Finder/Applications/Utilities/Terminal 14.3.2 On a Windows PC Go to Applications/Terminal 14.4 The Yawning Blackness of the Terminal Window So, you have managed to open a terminal window, which has a standard UNIX prompt, ending in something like % or $. Not terribly helpful, is it? The bash shell is waiting for you to enter a command. No user interface for you! Let’s start with a simple one, which can’t do any harm. Run the command below: whoami whoami ## peterhiggins Remember that UNIX started out as an operating system for terminals, and knowing who was logged in was a helpful thing. You can string together two commands with a semicolon between them. Try the following: whoami;date ## peterhiggins ## Wed Jun 16 19:42:55 EDT 2021 OK, fine. This is sort of helpful. It was really important when you were on a terminal and paying by the minute for time on a mainframe back in 1969. And, on occasion, if you will need to use an entire computer cluster to run a script (or scripts) on a lot of data, you will likely have to use some of this command line knowledge. You can even schedule jobs (scripts) to run when your time is scheduled on the cluster with cron and crontab. At this point, it would be helpful to open a window with your Documents folder, and keep it side by side with the window in which you are reading this e-book. We will start working with files and directories, and it is helpful to see changes in your file/folder structure in real time. As we run commands in the bash shell, check them against what you see in the folder window. You may find that some files (dotfiles, starting with a period) are hidden from the user to prevent problems that occur when these are deleted. 14.5 Where Are We? OK, let’s start looking at files and directories. Start with the pwd command, which does not stand for password, but for print working directory. Run the code below in your Terminal window. pwd ## /Users/peterhiggins/Documents/RCode/rmrwr-book You can see the full path to your current directory. This can be a bit obscure if you are just looking at your folder structure, particularly at the beginning of the path. Fortunately, the {here} package handles a lot of this for you when you are working in Rstudio projects. We think of the directory as a tree, with a root - in this case, Users, and various branches as you build out folders and subfolders. We can move up and down the folders of the directory paths with the cd command, for change directory. Try this command in your Terminal Window, and see if you can figure out what it does. cd .. It changes the directory up one level closer to the root directory. It is straightforward to go up the directory tree, as each folder only has one parent. But it is tricky to go down the directory tree, as there are many possible branches/children, and you do not inherently know the names of these branches.

You can get more details by adding the option (sometimes called a flag) -l cd /Users/peterhiggins/Documents/; ls -l The full listing will give you more details, including read &amp; write permissions, file size, date last saved, etc. Many commands have options, or flags, that modify what they do. Find a folder inside of your Documents folder. We will now go down a level in the directory tree. In my case, I will use the Powerpoint folder. In your Terminal window: change the directory to the Powerpoint directory list the contents of this folder cd /Users/peterhiggins/Documents/Powerpoint; ls ## 2016IBDClinTrialsforMDsDearborn.pptx ## 2016IntegratedDeckorMDsGB.pptx ## 2019 SCSG GI Symposium IBD SoA - Read-Only.pptx ## Annual Research Career Review 2021PH.pptx ## BE LGD Dearborn 2016.04.12.pptx ## CCF_Clinical_Trials.pptx ## Feasibility and Pilot Studies.pptx ## Getting Started in RStudio.pptx ## Higgins Microbiota for IBD Patient Ed.pptx ## HigginsDec2018AJG_SmokingStatus.pptx ## IBDUpdate.pptx ## Integrated Slide Deck Dearborn 2016.04.12.pptx ## MER Stress Management Dearborn 4-14.pptx ## MichiganMedicine-IBDTemplate.potx ## PDRH RCR 2020.pptx ## PennThioMTX2017Higgins.pptx ## Pregnancy in IBD.pptx ## Regenbogen CRS for GI CME Course2016.pptx ## Senior Slide Show.pptx ## Social Media for GI.pptx ## ThomsonRectalStumpComplicationsIBD2_13.pptx ## UEGweek2020.pptx ## UMHS Talk- Moving Beyond AntiTNF 4-2016 FINAL v2.pptx ## UMich COVID-19 IBD.pptx ## Vertebrate Animals for K.pptx ## VirtualPtEdMar2020.v2.pptx ## Writers Room.pptx ## ibd_meds_surgery_metan.pptx Great! You moved to a new directory and listed it. Now we will get fancy, and make a new directory within this directory with the mkdir command. Try this in your Terminal window: pwd; mkdir new_files; ls You have now made a new directory (folder) within the previous directory, named new_files. Verify this in your Documents folder. You can now change to this directory and list the contents (it should be empty). Try this out in your Terminal Window (note edit the cd command to your own directory path). cd /Users/peterhiggins/Documents/Powerpoint/new_files; ls Note that you can abbreviate the current directory with ., so that you could have also used cd ./new_files You can create a new (empty) file in this directory with the touch command. Sometimes you need to create a new file, then write data to it. Try this out touch file_name; ls You can also create a file with data inside it with the cat &gt; command. Type in the following lines into your Terminal window. When complete, type control-D to be done and return to the Terminal prompt. cat stands for concatenate. cat &gt; file2.txt cat1 cat2 cat3 Now you can list the contents of this file with the cat command below. Give this a try cat file2.txt You can also list the directory of your new_files folder with ls to see the new folder contents. Try this ls Note that you don’t need to use the Terminal to run bash commands. You can do this from an Rmarkdown file. Take a moment to run pwd in your Terminal, to get the current directory. Now open Rstudio, and a new Rmarkdown document. Copy the path to the current directory from the Terminal. Switch back to the Rmarkdown document. Select one of the R code chunks (note the {r} at the top) and delete it. Now click on the Insert dropdown at the top of the document, and insert a Bash chunk. Now add UNIX commands (separated by a semicolon), like cd (paste in path here); pwd; ls; cat file2.txt Then run this chunk. Now you can run terminal commands directly from Rmarkdown! 14.6 Cleaning Up OK, now we are done with the file file2.txt and the directory new_files. Let’s get rid of them with rm (for removing files) and rmdir for removing directories. In order, we will - Make sure we are in the right directory - remove the file with rm file2.txt - go up one level of the directory with cd .. - remove the directory with rmdir new_files Give this a try pwd; rm file2.txt; cd ..; rmdir new_files Verify all of this in your Documents window. This is great. But you can imagine a situation in which you mistakenly rm a file (or directory) that you actually needed. Unlike your usual user interface, when a file is removed at the command line, it is gone. It is not in the trash folder. It is gone. There is something to be said for modern user interfaces, which are built for humans, who occasionally make mistakes. Sometimes we do want files or folders back. 14.7 Other helpful file commands Here are some file commands worth knowing cat filename - to print out whole file to your monitor less filename - to print out the first page of a file, and you can scroll through each page one at a time head filename - print first 10 lines of a file tail filename - print last 10 lines of a file cp file1 file2 - copy file1 to file2 mv file1.txt file.2.txt file3.txt new_folder - move 3 files to a new folder 14.8 What about R? So now you can get around directories, and find your files in the Terminal window, but you really want to run R. You can launch an R session from the Terminal Window (if you have R installed on your computer) by typing the letter R at the Terminal prompt Launch R R You get the usual R intro, including version number, and the R&gt; prompt. Now you can run R in interactive mode with available datasets, or your own datasets. Try a few simple commands with the mtcars dataset. Give the examples below a try. You can use q() to quit back to the terminal (and reply “n” to not save the workplace image). head(mtcars) ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 ## gear carb ## Mazda RX4 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 4 4 ## Datsun 710 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 3 2 ## Valiant 3 1 mtcars %&gt;% filter(mpg &gt; 25) %&gt;% select(starts_with(&#39;m&#39;)|starts_with(&#39;c&#39;)) ## mpg cyl carb ## Fiat 128 32.4 4 1 ## Honda Civic 30.4 4 2 ## Toyota Corolla 33.9 4 1 ## Fiat X1-9 27.3 4 1 ## Porsche 914-2 26.0 4 2 ## Lotus Europa 30.4 4 2 14.9 What about just a few lines of R? Sometimes you will want to call R, run some code, and be done with R. You can call R, run a few lines, and quit in one go. Just add the flag -e (for evaluate) to the call to R, and put the R commands in quotes. Try the example below (note that this will not work if you are still in R - be sure you are back in the terminal with the % or $ prompt) R -e &quot;head(mtcars)&quot; or this example - note that single or double quotes does not matter - as long as they match. Try this R -e &#39;install(palmerpenguins)&#39; You can also string together several commands with the semicolon between them. Try the example below. R -e &#39;library(palmerpenguins);data(penguins);tail(penguins)&#39; 14.10 Running an R Script from the Terminal Now we are stepping up a level - you have an R script that you have carefully created and saved as the myscript.R file. How do you run this from the Terminal? This is easy - just call the Rscript command with your file name. Pick out a short R file you have written, make sure you are in the right directory where the file is, and use it as in the example below. Rscript myscript.R This launches R, runs your script, saves resulting output (if your script includes save or ggsave commands), closes R, and sends you back to the Terminal. Very simple. 14.11 Rendering an Rmarkdown file from the Terminal This is a little different, as you can’t just run an Rmarkdown file. Normally you would use the dropdown button to knit your file from Rstudio. But you can use the rmarkdown::render command to render your files to HTML, PDF, Word, Powerpoint, etc. Pick out a simple Rmd file like output_file.Rmd below, make sure you are in the right directory where the file is, and try something like the example below. Note that this is one case where nesting different types of quotes (single vs. double) can come in handy. It helps to use single quotes around your filename and double quotes around the rmarkown::render command. Try it out Rscript -e &quot;rmarkdown::render(&#39;output_file.Rmd&#39;)&quot; So there you have it! Just enough to get you started with R from the command line.
